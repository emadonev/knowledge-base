We can measure the efficiency of an algorithm based on the time it takes to finish its operations. We denote this with the "big O notation", and it represents the growth of the time it takes to run the algorithm as a function of the amount of data points in the data set. 

> $O[N]$ is the time it takes for processing proportional or linear time&data increase
> $O[log N]$ - the time does not increase by much for large data points.
