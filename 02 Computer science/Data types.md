The 3 main types of data are as follows:
1. **Continuous data(real numbers)**: quantitative measurements of the real world, most commonly over a period of time([[Timeseries data]]). They often have some measurement error or [[Uncertainty]] in them. 
	1. *Circular variables* are when the highest value is right next to the lowest value (angles in a circle,...)
2. **Ordinal data**: discrete values which can be ordered(spectral classification)
3. **Nominal data**: descriptive and unordered data, categories of objects.
