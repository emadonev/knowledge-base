**Hash tables** are data structures which store items, where each item has its own unique key, kind of like a label. Using a ***hash function*** it calculates the index of the item you are looking for based on the key and stores the value of this index in an array. It is very efficient, and it knows where each item is stored.

However, in practice they are not quite practical all the time, and [[One-dimensional trees and B-trees]] are more efficient because some items might have the same keys and then everything crashes.
