There are 7 types of computational problems, each requiring a different solution. These are broad categories which encompass many different subtopics and problems.

1. **Basic problems** - calculating basic stuff, typically simple to do
2. **Generalized N-body problem** - any problems involving distances or other similarities between pairs of points (or higher dimensions). A great example is a [[Near-neighbor search]]
3. **Linear algebraic problems** - linear systems, problems involving linear algebra
4. **Optimization problem** - problems where it is necessary to find the minimum or maximum of a function (best example are neural networks)
5. **Integration problems** - problems involving high-dimensional functions
6. **Graph-theoretic problems** - problems involving graph theory
7. **Alignment problems** - matching 2 or more datasets and seeing what you find (cross matching)
