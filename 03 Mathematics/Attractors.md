An **fixed point** is a point to which a certain chaotic model is attracted to: for each value of x produced by [[Mathematical models]], each value approaches our fixed point or attractor. The values try to reach it, sometimes getting infinitesimally close, and sometimes not. The numbers or values ==never make it to the center, or to the fixed point==. Graphing this motion of values as they approach the fixed point is called an **attractor**. 

We know that an attractor exists when we have a **dissipative dynamic system**. These systems, on average, shrink over time, telling us that an attractor exists. 

Any tiny change in the inital parameters of a [[Dynamical system]] can alter the appearance of an attractor, making the systems *structurally unstable*, because of the fragility of attractors. 

Atractors are often called **strange** because of the [[Fractals]] look. Strange provides the look of the attractor and chaos describes the dynamics of the attractor. 

The lines that many different initial conditions trace out in an attractor **never cross and never loop, hence they never repeat.** Attractors are **infinite curves in finite space**: [[Fractals]]!!!
