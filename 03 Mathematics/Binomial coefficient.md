This coefficient is defined as:
$$\begin{pmatrix}n\\k\end{pmatrix}=\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$
The coefficient represents the number of ways we can pick k objects from a group of n objects. The order doesn't matter! 

So, if we try to pick k objects, we can first pick from n objects, then n-1, then n-2... And there are k! ways to arrange the objects we picked from n. This is why we divide by k! because we do not want duplicates!
