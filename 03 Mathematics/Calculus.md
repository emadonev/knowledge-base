# What is a moment?
---
It is actually very difficult to define a moment, since a moment is actually **nothing** - a moment is like a snapshot in time, but it is actually 0s in length. Little frames shot out of the river of time. Considering these moments might seem meaningless, however if we want to know something <mark style="background: #ccd5ae;">exactly</mark> about an object, they are crucial in our understanding. Building up these moments using various tools give us insight into the world, even if Zeno would have stated otherwise.

A revolution came over when sir Isaac Newton proposed that an apple is the same as the moon - both are traveling at a certain speed in order to remain  tethered to Earth's gravity. Looking at the **small changes in the positions of the 2 objects** we can compare their motions and truly see that the moon does act as an apple - [[The universal law of gravitation]]. 

These *changes in moments of time* are called [[Derivatives]], and are a crucial tool of calculus. The opposite or composite of derivatives are [[Integrals]], which serve to combine these moments together into the endless scope of the universe. 

## What is calculus used for?
---
Calculus can be used for a multitude of things, from deriving an equation for practically everything in physics and astronomy to very easy **optimization problems**. When the derivative of a function is 0, we have reached its minimum or maximum, so, we have fully optimized a particular value. It is important to note that we can also try to optimize a quantity which has an infinite minimum or maximum, so, *be careful what you optimize...*
