A branch of mathematics which deals with chaotic systems, unpredictable systems. It tries to understand them and find ways to describe them.

The core of chaos is that tiny changes in the current state can have huge consequences in the far future. Most people, when they think of chaos, think of randomness. However, chaos is anything but random. It seems like that, but actually it is based on some properties, and we can sometimes predict chaos! 

Three main concepts of chaos theory:
1. [[Sensitive dependence]]
2. [[Determinism]]
3. [[Non-linearity]]

Chaos theory "helps us cope with unstable systems by improving our abilty to describe, to understand, perhaps even to forecast them." *from Chaos: A Very Short Introduction*

In simple terms, chaos is the mechanism which propagates uncertainty at an exponential rate through our models or unstable systems. This mechanism usually sets in after the initial parameters are tweaked or set up. The tweaking of the parameters can be unpredicted, and free will is another source of set up for inital parameters. "*the [[Uncertainty]] that chaos acts on is only the uncertainty of the initial state*" from Chaos: A very short introduction. 

Chaos can only occur in [[Determinism]] systems, and it is both deterministic and unpredictable. If we entered the exact same initial parameters, we would get the same result. However, if we tweak it ever so slightly, we get an entirely new picture of the world.

Chaos is a huge battle between observations and mathematics, empirical fact and scientific fiction.
