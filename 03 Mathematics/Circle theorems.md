## 4 points of a circle
---
If 4 points are connected together inside a circle, and each point touches the circumference, then **the opposite angles add up to 180ยบ.**

## Intersecting chords
---
If two chords, $AB$ abd $CD$ meet in point $P$, then:$$AP * BP = CP*DP$$

$$PA*PB = PT^2$$

## Really weird circle theorem
---
![[weird circle theorem.png|400]]
This extraordinary theorem states that$$a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 4R^2$$
## Ceva's theorem
---
If we have a triangle, and all of its points are connected with a random point on the opposite side, and all 3 lines meet at some point P. We can call the vertices $A, B, C$ and the points on the sides $X, Y, X$. Then:$$\frac{BX}{XC} \frac{CY}{YA}\frac{AZ}{BZ} = 1$$
