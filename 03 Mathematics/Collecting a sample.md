RELATED: [[Population and sample]]

The most important part about a sample is that it **must be representative of the population.** However, if we knew how the population looks like, we wouldn't really need samples in the first place. This is called **the paradox of sampling**. However, the problem is partially fixable, it can't ever be 100% because we always have uncertainty, but using [[Statistics]], we can infer about our population and sample!

There are a few ways to make samples representative of a population. The first step is to choose members of a sample **randomly.** This way, each member is fairly a part of the sample, however this is quite hard to achieve. The problem lies in **bias,** which limits our capabilities of "randomness". 

In order to avoid bias, we can use *mechanical or blind methods of collecting a sample.* This makes it easier to pick random members.

When we do not have bias (and bias is very easy to have), our sample is **balanced.** This means that from our population, the same percentage of all members in the sample are the same as in the general population. 

We also have what's called a **stratified random sample.** This is when different characteristics of our members of our sample affect the generalization and we have to take that into account.
