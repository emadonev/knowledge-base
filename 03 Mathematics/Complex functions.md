Complex functions are more complicated [[Functions]] with [[Imaginary numbers]] as their components in complex numbers. Now, instead of the [[Cartesian coordinate system]] where we can view the input and output simultaneously, here since the beginning plot is 2D, we would need 4 dimensions to visualise this and that is sadly ==impossible==. So we use a special complex plane for the *input* and the *output*. 

Amazing stuff happens. When we map the input and the output, the plots are completely different and amazing structures arise. 

Let's try and work on the function $$f(x) = x^2 + 1$$. Since we are multiplying $x*x$, this has something to do with complex multiplication which is talked about in the note about [[Imaginary numbers]]. The $+1$ here is completely boring, so let's actually just leave it out. If we compare the input and output planes, we would notice that if we drew straight lines through the origin (so keeping the same angle in the input value), the output plot would ==double the angle==!
Something similar happens with the distance form the origin.

But, a problem arises when we realise that 2 inputs have the same output. Since we can't visualise 4D space,
