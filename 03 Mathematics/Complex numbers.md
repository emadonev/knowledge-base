The 2 assumptions we make about complex numbers or imaginary numbers are as such:
1. The square of some number, $i$ is $-1$. 
2. That the imaginary numbers($i$) are on the number line perpendicular to the real number line.

### Adding 2 complex numbers
It is useful to think about complex numbers as **vectors**. If we graph 2 numbers, let's say $-2+2i, 4+i$, as vectors reaching from the centre, we would add the real and the imaginary components, so the answer would be:
$$(-2+2i) + (4 + i) = 2+3i$$
### Multiplying 2 complex numbers
Let's try and multiply 2 numbers just like in normal arithmetic:
$$i(3+2i) = 3i -2$$
Now, notice that if you want to **rotate** some point by 90º on a 2D plane, you would do the following:
$$(a,b)→ (-b, a)$$
And if we look at the previous multiplication, we can see that:
$$(3,2i)→(-2, 3i)$$, due to the multiplication of i. So $i$ has a property of *rotation!*

## Rotation!
There are 3 key facts in rotation (multiplication) using $i$:
1. $z*1=z$
2. $z*i=Rot90(z)$

3. $z*(c+di) = cz + d(zi)$
