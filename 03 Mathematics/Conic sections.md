**Conic sections** are when we cut a plane through a cone! Different ways of cutting give us 4 different kinds of shapes:

>A **circle** has an eccentricity of 0, and its focus is in its centre. $r$ is always constant, and defined as: $$x^2 + y^2 = 1$$ 

> An **ellipse** has an eccentricity from 0 to 1, not including both, and we relate the radius as $$r = \frac{a(1-e^2)}{1+e\cos\theta}$$

> A **parabolla** is a graphed [[Quadratic equation]], and its eccentricity is exactly equal to 1. We define its radius as:$$r = \frac{2p}{1+\cos\theta}$$, where $p$ is the distance of the closest approach to the 1 focus of a parabola, at $\theta = 0$. 

> A **hyperbola** has an eccentricity greater than 1, and we define its radius as:$$r = \frac{a(e^2-1)}{1+e\cos\theta}$$

- eg **Circles and ellipses** are for [[Planetary orbits]], while **parabolas and hyperbolas** are for [[Comets]] and [[Asteroids]] which fly through [[The solar system]].
