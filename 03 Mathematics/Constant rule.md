[[Derivatives]] is are enormously useful tool in [[Calculus]], however it is necessary to know the rules of derivatives in order to solve them.

The most basic rule is the **constant rule**, which states that:
- eg Constants can move in and out of derivatives, since derivatives are the rate of change constants can be scalarly multiplied by them:$$\frac{d}{dx}[cf(x)] = c\;\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)]$$
