When converting from [[Polar coordinate system]] to the [[Cartesian coordinate system]], we can see that the length (r) is proportional to the x coordinate and the angle (θ) is proportional to the y coordinate.  Note that in all of the conversions we use [[Fundamental trigonometry]]. 

1. Converting from polar to cartesian
	1. We have r and we have θ
	2. Using r and θ we can get y by $y=r*sinθ$ and x by $x=r*cosθ$
	3. We now have (x,y) of our point
2. Converting from cartesian to polar
	1. Pythagorean theorem
		1. Since the triangle with sides r, x, y is a right angled triangle, we can get r using the Pythagorean theorem
		2. Using r and another side like x we can get θ using $θ=arc sin \frac{x}{r}$ 
	2. Using [[Fundamental trigonometry]]
		1. Tangent of x and y
		2. Calculating the angle θ using the arc tan function
		3. using θ and another side eg. x to calculate r using sinus
