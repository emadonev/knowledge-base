Counting is surprisingly hard! Imagine having to count all of the possible scenarios for [[Probability]]! There are 2 different types of counting:
1. **Permutations**: counting ordered sequences (combinations where **order matters**)
2. **Combinations**: counting unordered sequences (combinations where **order doesn't matter**)

The more starting collection of elements we have, the **faster the number of permutations grow!**

However, the deeper we go into counting **combinations**, it eventually levels down to one combination (if we draw trees!)
