A source of changing observations, where [[Chaos theory]] is at the core.

There are 3 types of dynamical systems
- *mathematical dynamical systems*
	- process of **iteration**: we feed in a number, perform [[A map (mathy sense)]], and then we feed the given number, etc.
	- our observations are noisy snipets of reality
- *physical dynamical systems*
	- perfect observations or recordings of reality, no noise
- *computer simulation*
	- when a computer does arithmetic governed by a math dynamical system

Every dynamical system has 3 main parts: [[A map (mathy sense)]] or a mathematical rule which creates means to conjure numbers, the parameters and the current state.
