When looking at our data and making it presentable, there are bound to be **errors.** However, not just human errors. 

Every measurement which we take has some [[Uncertainty]], which forbids us to reach [[The TRUE value]] which is obviously optimal for statistics. So, we always have to include our error, or +- something to denote we are only **approximating** the value. This is why it is important to be very diligent when measuring and trying to be as precise as possible, in order to limit our errors and improve our predictions.
