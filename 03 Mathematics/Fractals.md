There are 2 types of fractals:
- Mathematical fractals
- Physical fractals
	- ==displays properties of a fractal at certain scales==
		- there exists a limit to physical systems: we cannot zoom in forever
	- coastlines
	- mountains
	- clouds
		- all examples of natural fractals: statistically self-similar objects

but fractals all follow the rule that they are **self similar.** If we zoom in into a particular part of an object and see the bigger part of the obect repeating, that is a fractal. 
If the zoom is exactly the same as the original set: **strictly self-similar.**
If only statistical properties are repeated: **statistically self-similar.**

A famous paradox involving fractals as a solution is [[Olber's paradox]].
