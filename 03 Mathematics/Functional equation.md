This type of equation is where we are **not solving for a specific number or variable**, the equation works for **any number**, however we are trying to deduce **the function instead!** 

A great way to start is to introduce a helper function. This function is a simplified version of our starting function which generates a property which is super useful and we can apply it to our starting function.
