 The beauty of geometry lies in the fact about how **visual** it is, giving us so much intuition and understanding, much more than numbers on a page can. We can literally *see* the solution, the proof, look for ways to solve a problem. 

# Intuitive proofs

Rather than always relying on rigorous algebraic manipulations or hard-core geometry proofs, a simple and intuitive way of thinking about geometry is through **movement without motion**, or through [[Transformations]]. They take a point, line, shape, anything, plotted on a [[Cartesian coordinate system]], and apply various transformations to prove various geometrical concepts. 

Now, the ==key== to transformations is the fact that ==we don't actually move, but just transform, which is a bit like teleportation==. 

- !! The trouble with motion is **Zeno's paradox**: he states that if we need to travel between 2 points, A and B, we can make an infinite amount of midpoints which we need to traverse, *but if we need an infinite number of steps to get from A to B, we will never move*. Now, we **do** move in the real world, but **experimental data does not mean rigorous logical proof**. So, as a workaround, we developed *geometrical transformations*, which are just "transporting" objects, while not actually moving them.

With this powerful tool in hand, we can approach almost any geometrical problem with a bit more intuition, while still keeping logical rigor in our methods.
