### 1. Non-negativity axiom:
For any event A, the probability of this even occurring is a non-negative real number:
$$
p(A) ≥ 0
$$
### 2. Unit measure axiom:
The probability of a sure or certain event is obviously equal to one.
$$p(S) = 1$$
### 3. Additivity axiom:
The probability of at least one of the events from a sequence of mutually exclusive events happening is equal to the sum of their individual probabilities.
$$
p(∪ A_i) = \sum^∞_{i=1} p(A_i)
$$

- Mutually exclusive events are those which cannot happen at the same time. Hence, the probability of them both occurring is the sum of each's probability. 
- in other words, if we want to calculate the probability of an event it is the sum of all the outcomes the event comprises of.
