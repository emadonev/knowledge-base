Limits are central for [[Calculus]], and both [[Derivatives]] and [[Integrals]] are built on the basis of limits. They are values that **we forever approach**, ==but never quite reach==. It's like saying that $dx$ approaches 0, but in order for the universe to work *it can never quite reach 0*. 
- !! $$lim \; dx\ce{->}0$$
