A model is a map that describes as closely as possible reality around us. A good model means that our observations in nature closely match our mathematical predictions, so the points lie close to the curve **but not on the curve**. A mathematical model generalizes the data we have, and is trying to predict the situation around us based on data. However, not every model is a good one. It might be underfitting (not good enough), or [[Overfitting]] (accounting for random fluctuations). 

When you think about it, everything we use to describe nature, our equations, laws, etc. are all **very good models** for explaining the world around us. They can never be exact-mainly because measurements **are always subject to error**, and a small initial error can (or cannot) spiral into a very large total error. If we reduce the uncertainty to zero, then we **can predict perfectly well.** However, can we ever be sure of our initial conditions, since we do not know what [[The TRUE value]] really is. 

>**Observational uncertainties are caused by noise.**
>- Chaos: a very short introduction

We create a model by identifying a *real world problem* for which we formulate a *mathematical model* based on our knowledge of math, be it with [[Geometry]], [[Calculus]] or something else. We then solve for this model and create a *mathematical conclusion*, which we later interpret with *real-world predictions.* We test our model, and if it doesn't work for different data, we repeat the process.

These types of models aren't real *physical* models, rather they are just here **to try and fit data to the best of math's powers.**

We have 2 types of models:
- ==linear models==
	- based on [[Linearity]]
	- the error does not grow exponentially
		- apparent advantage of linear models
	- uses the **linear function** or [[Linear function equation]] to describe proportional data or, well, simple data ($y = ax+b$)
	- we use [[Linear regression]], or the ***method of least squares*** to find the best model
		- when we look for values between data its called ==interpolation==, but looking for values outside of our x-axis is ==extrapolation==.
- ==non-linear models==
	- based on [[Non-linearity]]
		- the error can grow exponentialy
		- extremely costly to decrease [[Uncertainty]], so we **cannot forecast far into the future**
	- can be presented with [[Polynomials]]
	- with **power and root functions**
	- [[Fundamental trigonometry]] functions
	- exponential and logarithmic functions
