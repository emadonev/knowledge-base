A model is a map that describes as closely as possible reality around us. A good model means that our observations in nature closely match our mathematical predictions, so the points lie close to the curve **but not on the curve**. A mathematical model generalizes the data we have, and is trying to predict the situation around us based on data. However, not every model is a good one. It might be underfitting (not good enough), or [[Overfitting]] (accounting for random fluctuations). 

When you think about it, everything we use to describe nature, our equations, laws, etc. are all **very good models** for explaining the world around us. They can never be exact-mainly because measurements **are always subject to error**, and a small initial error can (or cannot) spiral into a very large total error. If we reduce the uncertainty to zero, then we **can predict perfectly well.** However, can we ever be sure of our inital conditions, since we do not know what [[The TRUE value]] really is.

We have 2 types of models:
- ==linear models==
	- based on [[Linearity]]
	- the error does not grow exponentially
		- apparent advantage of linear models
- ==non-linear models==
	- based on [[Non-linearity]]
		- the error can grow exponentialy
		- extremely costly to decrease [[Uncertainty]], so we **cannot forecast far into the future**
