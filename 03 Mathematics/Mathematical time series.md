If some quantity changes over time, the sequence of data is called a ==time series==. Eg. a population of rabbits like in the [[Fibonacci sequence]], the numbers are a time series because they model the rabbit population over ==some period of time==.

4 things can happen when these series evolve over time:
1. they can halt and repeat the same number over and over again
2. repeat a closed loop
3. move inside a loop where it doesn't repeat exactly the same, but close enough
4. forever jump around wildly

The **inital number** with which we begin a time series is called the *initial condition or state*. The **state space** is the collection of all possible states of the time series. Sometimes the inital number will contain more components (an infinite amount really), because we need to feed in more numbers for the initial conditions. An *unbounded* time series is when the numbers grow without a limit. The first part of a time series, where the values approach a **periodic loop** is called the **transient**.
