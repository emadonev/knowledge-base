A system which is not exhibiting [[Linearity]]. They are critical to [[Sensitive dependence]], and hence [[Chaos theory]]. A non-linear system has an exponential factor, which increases growth exponentialy. The [[Quadratic equation]] is a standard example of a non-linear function. The way in which non-linearities grow is **exponential growth**. It uses the principle of a [[A map (mathy sense)]] to create exponential growth. We can notice that it can quickly spiral out of control and all proportion, and how even taking something simple as the square of the previous square can quickly become extremely large. This kind of growth is **much much** faster than linear growth (which is proportional). By changing the parameters of eg. the [[Linear function equation]] or the [[Quadratic equation]] can alter the rate of growth. A thing to note is that exponential growth is **always** faster than linear growth. In these systems, all of its factors are interconnected, and they depend on each other, forming a circular dependance. 

Non-linear equations can generate deterministic chaos, or rather that apparent randomness is actually orderly.
