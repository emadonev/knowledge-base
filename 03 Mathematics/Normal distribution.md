This type of [[Distribution]] is the most "perfect" distribution, where all the numbers are symmetrically distributed. The mean, median and mode ([[Statistical functions]]) are all in the same place, at the peak of the distribution. It has a characteristic bell shape, with tapered edges. Finally, the amount of data under the curve is specific. 68% is within 1 [[Standard deviation]] from the mean, 95% of the data is within 2 standard deviations from the mean, and finally 99.7% is within 3 standard deviations. So, 34% is 1 standard deviation, 13.5% is in the second standard deviation, 2% is within the 3rd standard deviation and 0.15% is within the rest of the distribution (beyond the 3rd standard deviation). An important note is that if the data goes much further than 3 standard deviations, it isn't considered a normal distribution anymore.
