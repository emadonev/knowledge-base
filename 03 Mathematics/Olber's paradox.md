The paradox states: **Why is the night sky dark?**
- if space is infinite
- and there are soooo many stars
- and they are all uniformely distributed
	- **Why is the sky dark and not bright?**
	- ==The solution is [[Fractals]]!==

-> The distribution of matter was uniform, however in a fractal form. 
The universe (designed by Fournier), was a fractal from the infinitely large to the infinitesimaly small. This way, there are areas where the self-repeating pattern is not found. Here are areas with no stars, and **hence the universe is dark from Earth's viewpoint.**
