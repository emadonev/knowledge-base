> What are polynomials?
> 
> **Polynomials** are functions which contain 1 term or many terms. They can contain things like constants($1, 3, 2/3,...$), variables($x, y, s, z,...$) and exponents($x^2, y^4,...$). An important note is that they cannot contain **division or roots of variables.** Each polynomial has a *degree, or the value of the largest exponent*.

A turning point of a function is a point on the graph of a function where it changes from increasing to decreasing and vice versa. 

The maximum number of turning points in a graph is one less than the degree of the function.

Even degree polynomials have the same left and right behaviour (infinity!), while odd degree polynomials have different left and right behaviour: one is + infinity and the other - infinity.

### Degrees of polynomials
- the graph of every polynomial has exactly one y-intercept
- A **zero degree polynomial** is just a horizontal line, the function is $$f(x) = a$$
- A **first degree polynomial** is a line and is really a *linear function*. It's function is $$y = ax+b$$, where $a$ denotes the slope of the line and $b$ the y-intercept.
- A **second degree polynomial** is a parabola. It's function is $$f(x) = ax^2 - bx + c$$, where $a$ defines the shape, $b$ shifts the graph left or right, and $c$ defines the y position. This type of polynomial can have 0, 1 or 2 x-intercepts.
- A **third degree polynomial** is a weirdly shaped function hahaha! It's function is $$f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$$, where $a$ determines the shape, $b$ changes the curvature, $c$ changes the hight of the curves and $d$ changes the y position. It can contain 2 **turning points** and 3 x-intercepts. The same amount as the largest exponent.
- A **fourth degree polynomial** is the following function: $$ f(x) = ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e$$, and it can have 0,1,2,3 or 4 possible x-intercepts.

### Symmetry in graphs
For a graph to be symmetric about the origin, the input values of x and -x have to spit out the opposite output of y and -y. 

Polynomials are only symmetrical if they are even-degreed, and adding odd powers adds asymmetrical bumps to the graph. The opposite is true for
