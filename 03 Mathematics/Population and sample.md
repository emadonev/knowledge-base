In statistics, we cannot possibly analyze everything we get in the world. This is why we have **population**, or all the cases which statisticians want to take into account when making estimates or predictions (infering about the future). 

It is also important to note that not every aspect about each member of a population is important. Not all aspects are valuable to the research of a statistician. 

However, statisticians cannot analyze every member of a population (imagine analyzing every human on the planet!). This is why we have **samples**, or small subgroups of populations. Using the analysis of the samples they used, researchers can *generalize, and apply their results to the population. **They go beyond the information they were given.*** 

You might be wondering if this is reasonable. How can we possibly know if all of the members of a population will react the same way as to a generalization? Well, we can't. And this is where [[Statistics]] comes in, to try and see and quantify the probability of our errors. 

Each sample contains members which have certain characteristics. Each member will differ slightly from the other, depending on the varying characteristics each member contains. These characteristics are called [[Statistical variables]].
