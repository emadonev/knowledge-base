There are 2 types of distributions. **Discrete and continuous.** Discrete ones are the finite, the countable ones. The Continuous ones are the ones which are uncountable, the infinite ones. 

### Discrete distributions
The 2 discrete ones are the [[Poisson distribution]] and the [[Bernoulli and binomial distribution]].

### Continuous distributions
An important note here is that if [[Random variables]] are continuous, then the probability of picking one **is zero!** However, we use the [[Probability density function]] to figure out some [[Probability]]es. Here the distributions are the [[Exponential distribution]] and the [[Normal distribution]].
