Compound events are represented as sets, and probabilities as measures of these sets. It's like probability describes the sets of events. Eg. If we say "roll an odd number" as an event, the corresponding set would be $(1,3,5)$. 
1. A union of sets is the same as saying if **A or B** should occur
2. An intersection of sets is the same as if **A and B** should occur
3. A complement of a set A is the same **as everything but A** should occur

So, using this logic, the complement of A refers to what is the probability of A **not occurring?** This is the same as calculating $1 - p(A)$, since we are dealing with percentages.
