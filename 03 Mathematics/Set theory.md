This branch of mathematics deals with ==sets==, or **groups of objects or numbers**. We can perform many operations with sets, particularly with the elements of each set!

## Union
A **union** of elements means that A union B contains all of the elements in A **or** B. The formal notation:
$$A∪B$$

## Intersection
An **intersection** of elements means that A intersection B contains all of the elements both in A **and** B. The formal notation:
$$A∩B $$
Graphical view:

## Complement
A **complement** of elements means that the complement of A selects all of the elements **which are not a part of A**. 
Formal notation:
$$A' $$

## Difference
A difference of elements means that the difference between A and B selects all of the elements which are **not part of A, but part of B.**
Formal notation:
$$A/B$$
