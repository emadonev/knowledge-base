This metric is used to measure the dispersion of data in a sample. We start of by looking at the average of the data. Then we look at how far away each value is from the mean. Since some values are negative, we square each difference in order for it to be positive. We divide this sum by the number of data points, to gain a sort-of new average. However, since everything is squared, we have to take the square root so the measurement units go back to normal. 
$$std = \frac{\sum (x-Âµ)^2}{n} $$
