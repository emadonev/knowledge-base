We can describe data with a number of statistical functions. We can establish the **range of data**, from the smallest value to the highest value with **quartal ranges in between.** 

**Median** is the centerpoint of the data, it is located exactly in the middle of an ordered array (distribution). It is a representative average value, but we'll get to average in a minute. Median is very commonly used to describe data, but it is very useful because, if you have outliers in your data, the median is not tugged around and is representative of the majority of your data. 

**Arithmetic mean** is the "average" of the data. We add all the values together and divide by the number of values to get the mean. 

We can think of the mean of a [[Probability]] distribution, or any statistical [[Distribution]] as the [[Expectation]] of [[Random variables]] (X). 

**Mode** is a statistical function which represents another "average" of data, this number representing which value was repeated most in the dataset. 

## Central tendency (averages)
This is the tendency that most of the data will be around some point, or the "center". We use mean, median and mode in various situations.
1. If we have a **categorical situation**, we use **mode!**
2. If we have **quantitative data** in some situations it is better to use **mean** and in others **median.**
	1. Mean is more stable as a function, and it is a great estimate of the population mean if we calculate the sample mean
	2. However, if we have untypically large elements in our sample, the mean gets easily distorted while the median does not


## Measures of dispersion
- the simplest method might seem to look at the difference between the minimum and the maximum value: the smaller the range is, the less variable or spread out it is. however, this is unreliable since the min and max values might be outliers 
- the **interquartile range** is much more representative of the dispersion or [[Distribution]] of the data.

While all of these functions help us understand data better, we do not know the shape of the [[Distribution]] of the data. This is where [[Variance]] and [[Standard deviation]] come in!
