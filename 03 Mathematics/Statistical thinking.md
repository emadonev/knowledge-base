There are 3 main steps to statistical thinking:
1. **summarizing**: we take in past experiences and summarize them (like taking in the data from past experience).
2. **generalizing**: generalization of the past experience to be true generaly
3. **predicting**: using the summary in order to make the generalization, we use the generalization to predict what is going to happen based on past experiences.

## Data and generalization
We, as humans, observe our surroundings carefully. We take in everything, and we **observe**. Everything we see is called an *observation*. While observing, we constantly *ask questions* and *try and connect things and make patterns*. Once we have a *collection of observations*, it is called **data**! 

==Statistics== is the science which *tries to make sense of observations.* It tells us **how to generalize based on our limited data.** The more data we have, the better our generalizations can be!
