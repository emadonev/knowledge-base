The different characteristics of each member who is part of a sample. They help us distinguish one member from another inside a sample. Some variables contain **categories** inside of them, like if I had "Type of notebook", I could list "spiral, lined, grid, dots, blank,...". These we will call category-variables. The name under which categories fall is called the **nominal variable**. If our category-variable has categories which can be arranged in a certain order, eg. from worst to best, then these are called **ordinal variables.** These can be separated into ordinal variables of ordered categories or ranks. 

>Remember!
>Between the different categories, the diference **does not have to be the same!**

If we have a variable which is not descriptive and can be quantitatively described, this is a *quantity which can be counted and/or measured.* These are called **quantity-variables.** There are 2 types of quantity-variables. 
1. *Discrete variables*: the values are separated one from another => ==counting==
2. *Continuous variables*: that the values are connected and there can be inbetween values => ==measurement== 

> Remember!
> We can always convert quantity variables into category variables by grouping certain values as some description. The downside is that we loose quite a bit of information because we loose the individuality of the data, or the exact values.
