Statistics can be used in 4 different senses to represent different ideas within the same field of mathematics:
1. *discpline*: a branch of mathematics
2. *methods*: methods of collection and processing of data aquired from our worldly observations
3. *collections of data*: the data aquired from observations which is then analyzed using *the methods*
4. *specially calculated figures*: some feature which sums up a particular part of data using a statistical method

It is used in almost every area of science, and is fundamental in how we percieve the world. Statistics arises as a tool we use when faced with predicting the future based on present data, or predicting some other factor using present data in which we have uncertainties. 

There are 2 main types of statistics:
1. **descriptive**: where we use our statistical methods to summarize the given data
2. **inferential statistics**: making predictions or estimates using given data
