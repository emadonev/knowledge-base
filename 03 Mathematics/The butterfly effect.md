The butterfly effect is an effect which is now part of [[Chaos theory]].
- a flap of a buttergflys wings can cause a hurricane
- the entire world is very interconnected, and basically everything matters but in a way we cannot describe
- small differences in initial conditions can lead to big changes in a period of time
- determinism is basically impossible
- there are always non-linear ways which have an impact
- things cannot be preedicted based on their initial predictions because everything is so chaotic
- scientists modeled chaotic attractors and 3D printed jewerly in the shape of those attractors
QUANTUM WORLD
- the butterfly effect does not work in the quantum world
- [[Quantum entanglement]]
- so we have **Alice**, who creates a piece of information and runs it backwards through gates in a [[Quantum computers]] mimicking time travel into the past. In the past, Bob takes her information, alters it slightly and sends it forwards through the gates, back to the future. because of the butterfly effect, in classical physics the information in the future should be completely altered. However, the information is essentialy unchanged, and Alice conserved her information. **the butterfly effect does not work on the quantum level!**
HISTORY
- women computer scientist Margaret Hamilton used to work on operating and programming the computer that Edward Lorenz used to run climate simulations
- after she finished her work and went to work on another project, a newbie Ellen Fetter learned how to operate the computer
- E.Lorenz was a climate scientist at MIT in 1963, when he started all of chaos theory. With the help of Margaret and Ellen, he managed to run computer simulations on climate weather, and decided to run the model again. However, this time when the model ran, it had 3 decimal places instead of 6. Expecting the weather to stay the same, he went to get a coffee, and when he returned, the prediction was entirely different!
- E. Lorenz was an avid mathematician, and later he started to work on meterology, but after discovering the butterfly effect he started to work with pure math again
- in the 1960's scientists hated weather forecasting
- people thought they could predict the future using the initial conditions and knowing the physical laws which govern our universe

"*The basic idea of Western science is that you don't have to take into account the falling of a leaf on some planet in athoer galaxy when you're trying to account for the motion of a billard ball on a pool table on earth. Very small influences can be neglected. There's a convergence in the way things work, and arbitrarily small influences don't blow up to have arbitrarily large effects*" taken from: Chaos

- any physical system that behaved nonperiodically would be unpredictable - E. Lorenz
- there is a link to unpredictability and aperiodicity: there is order masquerading as randomness
- in order to produce varied weather, the butterfly effect is necessary!

**- it contrasts two worlds: one with the tiny change and one without the tiny change**

The butterfly effect aims at the question: how well can we predict the future?

**"If you knew everything with infinite precision, you could predict the future infinitely in time."**

- seemingly random actions can have big long term effects
	- drawing random points on a piece of paper and then using a simple rule can create beautiful fractals!
- After a long time chaos starts to take form into beautiful [[Fractals]] and [[Attractors]]!
- we cannot retrace the butterfly after the tornado happened: we cannot back track!

"We recognize that affecting a small thing in the past can dramatically change the present, but yet we rarely think about how affecting a small thing in the present can dramatically change the future."
