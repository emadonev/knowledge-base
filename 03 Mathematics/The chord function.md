The chord function tells us how long is a chord length depending on the angle of the chord. A ==chord== is a line which connects 2 points on the circle. The angle which connects the points to the center of the circle is theta. If we draw vertical line with a 90º angle against the chord which passes through the center of the circle, we get 2 equal triangles. From this we conclude that the cord length of an angle theta is equal to 2 times the sinus of half of theta. The sine gives us the length of half of the chord.

$$
crd θ = 2 * sin \frac{θ}{2}
