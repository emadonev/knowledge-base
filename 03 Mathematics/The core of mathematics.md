What is math?
>A mathematician, like a painter or poet, is a maker of patterns. If his patterns are more permanent than theirs, it is because they are made with ideas.
> - G.H.Hardy

- mathematicians make patterns of ideas
- **simple is beautiful...** [[Math Without Numbers]]
	- the simplest possible things are the imaginary ones
- there is no alterior purpose to maths: its just playing around with the real world
- there is no reality to get in the way
- however the imaginary talks back to us, and we need to find out their properties, we do not control everything
*"This is what a piece of mathematics looks and feels like. That little narrative is an example of the mathematicianâ€™s art: asking simple and elegant questions about our imaginary creations, and crafting satisfying and beautiful explanations."*
