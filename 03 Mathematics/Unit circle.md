# Sine, cosine and radians
---
We can represent sine and cosine on the unit circle from [[Fundamental trigonometry]] like so:

A useful way to relate [[Radians]] to degrees on the unit circle is by using the next image and also remembering that $2ฯ = 360ยบ$:

If we were to use the pythagorean theorem to determine the coordinates of these main points (just like we might use to solve complex [[Imaginary numbers]] problems).

But what about $\frac{\pi}{6}$ ? These sections can be derived with the help of triangles which have equal length of all sides (60ยบ triangles). Via this we get the following chart:

And voila! We can use these unit circles in radians to super easily say what value is sine or cosine! We can switch back and forth between angles!
- n For example, we can say that if we are looking for: *What is the sine of $45ยบ$ angle?* And instead of grabbing for the calculator, we can just look at the chart and say, okay sine is the height so it is just $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$!

# Tangent on the unit circle
---
But what about the ==tangent==? We have mapped everything on the unit circle but the tangent! Where is it?
If we look at the unit circle from image (1), we can see that actually
$$tan(\theta) = \frac{y}{x}$$, where $x,y$ are coordinates ([[Cartesian coordinate system]]). 
- ! However! We have just discovered one of the most important theorems in trigonometry! $$tan (\theta) = \frac{sin(\theta)}{cos(\theta)}$$
