This theorem states that *if we take any quadrilateral*, basically any shape with 4 sides, and connect their middle points to each other, **we always get a pallalelogram!**

This is due to [[The midpoint theorem]], as we can divide any quadrilateral into 2 triangles, and the midpoints are parallel to one another and the bottom, hence they are equal in length and parallel. The same goes for the other two sides.
