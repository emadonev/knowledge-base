These types of operations are faster than regular operations because it processes multiple elements simultaneously, instead of one by one. We save the data in **vector or matrix form**, depending on the shape of the data. 

These operations are most commonly used with `arrays`, but they can also be used for other data types (rarely).

Vectorized operations are great for libraries like Pytorch and Numpy since they speed up many aspects of machine learning processes like **gradient descent** and the **optimization of parameters**.
