<mark style="background: #eaf2e3;">Scalars</mark> like temperature, mass, length, etc. are one-dimensional, since they have only a value like 27ºC, 56kg, 10cm, etc. <mark style="background: #f2e863;">Vectors</mark> are 2-dimensional, since they contain within them both *magnitude* (their actual value) and **direction**. Vectors are extremely useful for physics, since forces, velocity, acceleration, and lots of other quantities (fields) are represented with **vectors**, and not scalars.

#### Addition of vectors
Since vectors are slightly different from scalars, we add them and subtract them, multiply them with special *geometrical* methods.

- n We denote the magnitude of a vector like so:$$|\vec{a}|$$

So, the actual value of adding two vectors together requires a bit of [[Fundamental trigonometry]], where we look at the positions of the 2 vectors and using the **cosine law**, we can calculate the value of addition:
- f $$|\vec{a}| + |\vec{b}| = \sqrt{|\vec{a}|^2 + |\vec{b}|^2 - 2|\vec{a}||\vec{b}|cos\;\theta}$$

Subtracting is the same process as addition, however you **flip the b vector** so that its magnitude stays the same, but orientation is 180º different direction so it has a minus and then you add them together since + (-) is the same as -.

#### Multiplication of vectors
There are 2 different kinds of multiplication. There is the dot product which is essentially trying to see the *amount of each vector projected onto the other vector.*

So here, the amount of $\vec{b}$ projected onto $\vec{a}$ is $cos\;\theta*|\vec{b}|$. Hence the amount projected is:$$\frac{|\vec{a}||\vec{b}|}{|\vec{a}|} = cos\;\theta*|\vec{b}|$$ so:
- f $$\vec{a}\;\vec{b} = |\vec{a}||\vec{b}|cos\;\theta$$

We also have the cross product, whose resulting vector is directly perpendicular to the 2 vectors and is equal to the area of the parallelogram they produce.
