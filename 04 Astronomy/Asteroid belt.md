Between the hot and the cold, the asteroid belt lies. A collection of tiny asteroids, rocks, dust and small planetoids are a scar from the birth of the solar system. Jupiter's immense gravity tortured the asteroid belt. It accelerated the asteroids, pushing them into eccentric orbits or flinging them out of the solar system entirely. It hindered the growth of planets in the asteroid belt rather than promote it.
