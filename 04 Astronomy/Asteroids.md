Most asteroids are located in the [[Asteroid belt]] in the solar system, where scientists used different dating methods to determine the age of the asteroids, or how old were they. They got an estimate of 4,6 billion ywars, and we have learned that the **age of asteroids is the same as the age of the solar system!**
