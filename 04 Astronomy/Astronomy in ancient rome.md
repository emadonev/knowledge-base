# Planets
- most planets today are named after Roman gods:
	- Mercury: ==fastest of the planets==, *swift messenger* and the most intelligent of gods
	- Venus: ==brightest "star"== *goddess of beauty*
	- Mars:==red planet==, god of war
	- Jupiter:==largest planet==, god of sky and thunder (vrhovni bog)
	- Saturn: ==slowest planet==, god of agriculture/time?
	- LATER
		- Uranus: greek name, but originally it was **caelus**, god of the sky (greek is Ouranus, but it was **latinized**) 
		- Neptune: ==blue planet, ill tempered with strong winds==, Oceanus, Neptune!!
		- Pluto: ==farthest from the sun, dark and cold== - god of death
- all visible bodies were named after roman gods
	- Vesta: goddess of purity, hearth and home
"The Ancients knew there were five stars which roamed around the sky on various intervals, and they all resided in thirteen constellations in turn. They knew one of them was always near the Sun and difficult to find; another was present always in the evening or in the morning, one was red, one was bright and the fifth was blue." - resource 4

# Astrology (and astronomy general)
- romans believed that their destiny was written in the stars: astrology
- astronomy was at the very epicentre of Roman culture, politics, religious belief and philosophical thought, astronomy shaped the course of human history over many millennia
	- they thought that the time you were born and the positions of the bodies in the sky determined something in the future - hidden patterns
	- astrologers and astronomers were consulted for help in discerning the future for wars or for making big decisions

> *“Through astrology and the study of the heavens men may approach very near to the power of the gods.”*
> - Cicero, On Divination

*"The first emperor Augustus used his sign (Capricorn) on his coins and claimed that his elevation was foretold by his horoscope, but this reliance proved to be a double-edged sword. If astrology could predict an emperor’s right to rule it could also predict his death. In AD 11 Augustus restricted the casting of horoscopes and even expelled astronomers from Rome and his successor Tiberius went one step further. The story goes that he had his court astrologer Thrasyllus cast the horoscopes of important men, executing any who had the potential to supplant him. A later emperor, Septimius Severus, had his horoscope recorded on the ceiling of his palace, but left the critical details blank so his own death could not be foretold."* - resource 1

> *“The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars
> But in ourselves.”*
> - Caesar, WIlliam Shakespeare

- Roman astrologers established unique ways of interpreting the movements of celestial bodies and generating horoscopes, with their astrological predictions influencing personal and political decisions to a considerable extent - resource 2
	- since they thought everything was influenced by the heavens, they had very precise positions of celestial bodies and tracked them meticuously
	- the 12 zodiacs were born, each with their own characteristics, traits, weaknesses, etc.
- they thought that the heavens conveyed specific will of gods!
- For instance, the appearance of a comet was thought to signify impending disaster, while the alignment of certain planets was viewed as an auspicious omen. - resource 2
- Generals sought advice from astrologers before launching military campaigns, considering the alignment of stars and planets to influence the outcome of the battle. The belief was that the position of celestial bodies could impact the fate of the battle and the success or failure of the campaign.
- Roman astrologers could also predict natural disasters like earthquakes, floods, and droughts, often understood to be divine messages.

STORY:
Rulers would often consult their astrologers before making important decisions, obviously. According to the Roman historian Suetonius, an astrologer had repeatedly warned [Caesar](https://www.thecollector.com/5-facts-about-the-inner-life-of-julius-caesar/) that he would face great danger on the Ides of March. Despite being warned, Caesar decided to attend the Senate that day, where he was [assassinated by a group of conspirators](https://www.thecollector.com/julius-caesar-assassination/).

- Manilius wrote a poem called Astronomica which provided lots of knowledge of the zodiac, celestial spheres, constellations, etc.
![cellarius ptolemaic system](https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cellarius-ptolemaic-system.jpg?width=1400&quality=55)

- a very notable astrologer was Trasyllus of Mendes confirmed Tiberius' rise to the throne, and was highly regarded
	- personal astrologer of Roman emperor Tiberius
- Julius Firmicus Maternus
- Vettius Valens

**However...**
Cicero believed that:
>In his famous work, [_On Divination_](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/cicero/de_divinatione/1*.html), Cicero claimed that astrology was also dangerous because it encouraged fatalism, discouraging people from taking responsibility for their lives. He further alleged that astrologers were often motivated by greed for fame, with their predictions often designed to appeal to people’s fears or desires rather than being based on any actual scientific evidence.

- in the beginning astrology was in conflict with the roman government, but it became increasingly popular around 2.st. 
- later, astrology was again in conflict with the rise of christianity

# Astronomy, generally
- astronomy wasn't extremely advanced, as it was mostly used by
		- land surveyors
	- navigation of commercial ships
	- sundials for telling the time
- a lot of knowledge the romans got from the greeks, and took what they liked and discarded what they didnt like
> "One notable distinction of Roman scientists was their desire for authoritative answers to any questions they had about the world. In addition, for the practical Roman mind science had to provide useful information which could be used to ensure successful outcomes of real projects. Long and ultimately purposeless discussion and research on a purely theoretical level were not for the Roman scientist. Physics had to be of practical use to produce effective torsion catapults, biology must improve agricultural yields, and mathematics and geometry must combine to provide the best answers in order to build the most impressive domes and arches." - resource 5

- **Nigidius** (1st century BCE) - wrote works (which survive only in fragments) on astronomy, zoology, weather, and human nature.
- - **Vitruvius** (1st century BCE) - wrote an influential work on architecture (_De architectura_) which included surveying, town planning, mathematics, principles of proportion, materials, astronomy, and mechanics.
- **Marcus Manilius** (1st century CE) - wrote five volumes on astrology, his _Astronomica
 "Christians were wary of any scientific theories contrary to their view of the universe, but the two positions were not necessarily antagonistic, and several important scientists were actually Christians, for example Calcidius (c. 375 CE) who wrote widely on cosmology."
# Calendar
- the Julian calendar was created where it was based on the sun rather than the moon and was divided into 12 months. 
	- he changed the names of 7th and 8th month into July and August, removed the addition of days and solidified the calendar

- much of astronomy was adapted from Ptolemaic Egypt which Rome conquered
- Sundials were very popular
	- sundials with changeable discs to compensate for changes in location
		- they knew that time wasnt the same everywhere!
- as we know from Lobel's presentation, the original calendar was made with lunar cycles and it had 10 months, later January and February were added and in 46 BCE Julius Caesar changed the calendar to have 365 1/4 days and he changed 2 names after himself and his nephew
- the origin of a week comes from an ancient Jewish tradition, but it stayed and became widespread in Persia, Greece and Rome
- the **days** were named after **planets which "ruled" or rose first in the morning of each day**
- Saturday - Saturn (hence the name)
- Sunday - Sun (hence the name)
- Monday - Moon (hence the name)
- Tuesday - Mars (Norse god name)
- Wednesday - Mercury 
- Thursday - Jupiter
- Friday - Venus

# Star maps
- roman astronomers helped map out many stars
- ****Ptolemy****
	- alexandria, egypt but Egypt was a roman province! 
	- mapped out 1000 stars
	- studied motion of palnets and stars
	- able to create great maps
		- The Almagest, 48 constellations
		- named after roman mythology
# Constellations
- romans had their own constellations and adapted names and the shapes from other cultures
	- this led to the belief that the positions of celestial bodies has something to do with personality and life stuf
		- aquarius, capricorn, sagittarius, scorpio, libra, virgo, leo, cancer, gemini, taurus, aries and pisces were the constellations (with ophiuchus later)
		- **why are the constellations named so?**
>"*The Cygnus constellation can be seen in the Northern Hemisphere from mid-summer to the end of September. It is a distinctive cross-shaped constellation which got its name from Latinizing the Greek word for swan. You can find Cygnus where it flies south along the length of the Milky Way, neatly contained within the three stars of the Summer Triangle. There are many stories about Cygnus, the most popular describes how Zeus transformed himself into a beautiful swan to successfully trick beautiful Queen Leda into loving him. 
>
>Another story is of two friends, Cygnus and Phaethon, who were racing chariots across the sky. Their chariots began to melt as they strayed too close to the sun, and they fell towards the earth. Cygnus landed in some trees and was saved, but Phaethon crashed into a river and sank beneath the current. Cygnus could not swim, so implored Zeus to turn him into a swan so he could dive beneath the surface and save his friend.**Zeus was touched by such a display of friendship and granted Cygnus his wish.****Cygnus dove into the river and retrieved his friend, saving his life.****Zeus commemorated this display of friendship by immortalizing Cygnus in the sky forever.** The tale of Cygnus and Phaethon reminds us of the importance of friendship, and that loyalty and bravery are rewarded.*"

- mythology was a huge part of roman culture and soon it was completely tied in with astronomy

# Planetary motion
Ptolemy described the motions of the stars and planetary paths. Ptolemy argued that Earth was a sphere in the centre of the universe, based on the straightforward observation that half the stars were above the horizon and half were below the horizon.
	- According to Ptolemy's model of the solar system, Earth was stationary while the Moon, the Sun, the stars and other planets orbited it. Amazingly, even though Ptolemy’s cosmological model was too far from accurate, with minor adjustments, it endured more than a millenium, until the time of Copernicus who “made” Earth move from the centre.
	- _Almagest_ does not deal exclusively with Ptolemy’s own work; it includes a discussion of the astronomical achievements of the past, principally those of Hipparchus. Today, it is our main source of information about the work of Hipparchus and other Greek astronomers.
	- In his day, a complex universe centered on Earth was perfectly reasonable and, in its own way, quite beautiful. However, as Alfonso X, the King of Castile, was reported to have said after having the Ptolemaic system of planet motions explained to him, “**If the Lord Almighty had consulted me before embarking upon Creation, I should have recommended something simpler.”

![Ptolemy’s epicycles. A yellow dot labeled “Center” lies at the center of a blue circle which represents the orbit of a planet as seen from Earth. The large blue circle is labeled “Deferent” and has an arrowhead pointing counterclockwise. The Earth is drawn as a blue dot just to the left of center. To the right of center is a yellow dot labeled “Equant point”. An arrow labeled “y” is drawn from the equant to a point on the deferent, where a small arrow is then drawn pointing to another yellow dot. This yellow dot is the planet being observed. Centered on the point where the arrow from the equant meets the deferent, a circular arrow is drawn counterclockwise and is labeled “Epicycle”. The yellow dot of the planet lies on the epicycle.](https://pressbooks.online.ucf.edu/app/uploads/sites/40/2018/12/OSC_Astro_02_02_CSystem-1.jpg)

## Roman numerals
- greco-roman names are so ingrained into our culture, we use them today to name space missions:
	- APOLLO
	- GEMINI
- I, V, X, L, C, D, and M
- designating moons that orbit around various planets
- all constellations are named in latin
	- the naming of stars involves roman numerals
	- stars within a constellation is designated with a combination of a greek letter and the genitive form of the latin name of the constellation
		- example: $\alpha$ Ursae Majoris
			- the brightest star in Ursa Major
		- following the greek letter, a roman numeral might be found to indicate the star's brightness classification

# Church
- While it is true that the church condemned Galileo, new research shows that centuries of oversimplifications have concealed just how hard Rome worked to amass astronomical tools, measurements, tests and lore. - resource 11
- In its scientific zeal, the church adapted cathedrals across Europe, and a tower at the Vatican itself, so their darkened vaults could serve as solar observatories.
- Among other things, solar images projected on cathedral floors disclosed the passage of dark spots across the Sun's face, a blemish in the heavens, which theologians once thought to be without flaw.
- Rather, like many patrons, it wanted something practical in return for its investments: mainly the improvement of the calendar so church officials could more accurately establish the date of Easter. - ==patron odnosi!!!!==
- it was a problem that the church couldn't figure out a way to calculate when Easter was, so they funded astronomical research do devise the perfect method and calendar
- On each sunny day, the solar image would sweep across the church floor and, exactly at noon, cross a long metal rod that was the observatory's most important and precise part. The noon crossings over the course of a year would reach the line's extremities -- which usually marked the summer and winter solstices, when the Sun is farthest north and south of the Equator. The circuit, among other things, could be used to measure the year's duration with great precision.

# Byzanntine Rome
- A gradual improvement of methods, such as better use of the [astrolabe](https://www.ancient-origins.net/news-history-archaeology/earliest-known-marine-navigation-tool-revealed-scanning-technology-009046), culminated centuries later with the introduction of the heliocentric system, which correctly placed the sun at the center of our solar system. Gregoras, who lived between 1295 and 1360, understood the mechanism of eclipses, and he calculated all the solar eclipses of the millennium up to the 13th century. He also predicted future eclipses of both the sun and the moon, constructed a prototype astrolabe, and proposed reforms to the calendar, all of which led to great progress for human kind.
- or Chionades, Mercury and Venus are inner planets and, as seen from the earth, appear to follow the sun because they are sometimes ahead and at other times trailing the sun.
- Also, regarding Mercury, Chioniades makes an interesting remark concerning latitude. In his writings, he explains that among the five planets, four of them have their apogees (highest point) in the northern hemisphere of the globe, except for Mercury whose apogee is in the southern hemisphere. Was this the result of observations, or was he echoing an ancient tradition? We may never know, but this description of the latitudes survived after the introduction of the heliocentric system, with both Rheticus and Copernicus making similar observations.
- Years later, a mixed model with Venus and Mercury rotating around the Sun, and all of them together rotating around the earth, was introduced by Heraklides of Pontus.
