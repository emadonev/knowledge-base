When [[Neutron stars]] cannot support in their [[Stellar old age]] [[Neutrons]] degeneracy pressure, (we do not know yet of the limit of mass), it forms a **black hole**, since nothing can now halt the collapse of matter.

It is contained within a Schwartschzild radius, which we calculate via the escape velocity of light around a radius:
- f $$R = \frac{2GM}{c^2}$$
