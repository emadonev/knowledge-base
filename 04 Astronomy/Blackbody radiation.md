Blackbody radiation is when a **blackbody,** or an object which absorbs all wavelengths of light, radiates a from a certain range of wavelengths based on its temperature.

- from the graph above we can notice that as the temperature changes, the color and light emitted (thermal radiation ([[Thermodynamics]])) also change
- the heights of peaks significantly increase as we increase the temperature
- this type of radiation is covered by 2 laws: ==Wien's law== and ==Stefan's law==. The first related the temperature to the color, and the second related the temperature to the amount of energy flux emitted by square meter from the surface.

We can quantify the intensity of light for a given wavelength with Planck's formula of distribution:
$$I(\lambda, T) = \frac{\frac{2hc^2}{\lambda^5}}{e^{hc/\lambda kT} - 1}$$

==**Wien's displacement law**== is about the relationship between the most preferred wavelength(color) and temperature of a blackbody object. $$\lambda_{max}T = 0.002897755 \;m \;K$$
As the temperature increases, as we can see from the image above, the wavelength decreases, meaning hotter objects are lighter in color! [[Energy]] is inversely proportional to wavelength, so a spectrum shifted to higher energy needs to have shorter wavelength because then energy and temperature are proportional. If we wanted to calculate the total energy (luminosity) of an object which basically means the energy output from **all wavelengths**, we would integrate our intensity function ([[Stars]]) and come up with this: $$E = \sigma T^4$$
And luminosity is literally just the total energy multiplied by the area of the star. An Austrian physicist Josef Stefan in 1879 showed that the [[Luminosity]] of a blackbody object with an area and temperature is given by:$$L = AσT^4$$
Later, Ludwig Boltzmann derived the ==*Stefan-Boltzmann*== equation using [[Thermodynamics]] and [[Maxwell's Electromagnetic Wave Theory]]. $$L = 4πR^2σT_e^4$$, where $σ$ is equal to $5.670400 × 10^{-8} \; W m^{-2} K{-4}$. We use the above equation to define the surface temperature of a star's surface. This is an awesome equation which ties together luminosity and temperature together! If we wanted to know the flux of the surface of a star, we would just divide by the surface are and get the following: $$F_{surf} =σT_e^4 $$
# But why is it like this?

Why do objects glow when [[Heat]] is applied or when they produce heat themselves?

[[Atoms]] are made of [[Electron]]s, [[Protons]] and [[Neutrons]]. The electrons make up the ==electron cloud==, and each cloud is shaped into [[Orbitals]]. Each orbital has a specific energy level, as they are placed in specific [[Electron shell]]s. So, in order for **an electron to switch between orbitals, specific packets of energy are required!** So, the change in the position of an electron inside the atom creates [[Light]]! 

- eg If an atom vibrates at the right frequency due to heat being acted upon the atoms, the change in energy can cause the electron to jump the "ladders" or orbitals in the electron cloud. After the excitement, the electron ultimately wants to return to the ground state, and then it releases that energy in the form of photons.
- n You can probably notice the similarity between [[Blackbody radiation]] and [[Spectra]] and [[Spectroscopy]], except in spectroscopy its not inner heat which causes atoms to produce spectra (at least in cold clouds), but rather the hitting of light upon material and giving it energy.

So, that's why blackbody radiation works. The internal heat of an object heats up its atoms, and when they bump and vibrate against each other and even partly share their electron clouds and getting even more energy, they emit even more light. This is why ==hotter [[Stars]] glow brighter and vice versa==.

But let's be more specific. What exactly happens in stars?

### Blackbody radiation in stars

So, in stars we have a new type of material, [[Plasma]]. Here, electrons ==are detached== from their "host" atoms, and so they aren't bound by their energy usage. These electrons are called **free electrons**, and they can contain as much energy as they want! However! Since there are many free electrons in the cores and layers of stars, they bump into each other ==a lot==, **significantly reducing their kinetic energy**: this reduction causes them to release photons to mediate that change in energy: and voila! Blackbody radiation or light is emitted from stars at a very high rate! 

- eg In a nutshell, blackbody radiation is the **radiation that comes from within the object and isn't reflected or transmitted by other light sources**. The hotter an object is, the more it becomes a blackbody object and transmits and reflects less light. 

So the core principle of  these stars is that they try to approximate **thermodynamic equillibrium**, which basically means that there is <mark style="background: #d4a373;">no net energy flow between the star and the surroundings</mark>.
