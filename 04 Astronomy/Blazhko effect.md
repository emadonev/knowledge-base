This effect is one effect which is still not fully or understood at all. It says that some variable stars, most notably [[RR Lyrae]] stars exhibit **modulations of their light curves**. This means that over a period of time, their light curves change in amplitude and even periods. The reason why for this is not understood and we do not yet know why.

It has been observed that around a third of RRAB stars are Blazhko stars, while only a small percentage of RRC stars are Blazhko stars. 

Quite a few effects could be responsible for the Blazhko effect:
1. ==Resonance effect== : the fundamental pulsation might be in resonance with an overtone (as is shown later)
2. ==Nonadiabatic effect== : layers of the star move around causing temperature and [[Luminosity]] changes
3. ==Magnetic effect==: the magnetic field interferes with particles during pulsation
4. ==Tidal effects in blazhko stars==: the shape of stars changes due to tidal forces but this is probably not the reason for the blazhko effect
5. ==Mode mixing==: a sudden change when different pulsating modes pulsate at the same time


There have been quite a few theories floating around about the Blazhko effect:
1. Resonance between the radial fundamental and non-radial pulsation modes ([[Pulsation principles of stars]]) ==very strong theory==
2. Due to the magnetic effect the radial mode is deformed hence causing the blazhko effect - rotation axis of the star is not aligned with the magnetic poles, however it was found that *Blazhko stars don't have strong magnetic fields, hence the fields aren't responsible for the effect*
3. that the effect might have an origin into the dynamical side of RR Lyrae
4. There is a strong connection between [[Period doubling]] and the blazhko effect ==very strong evidence==
5. Exploring the non-radial pulsation modes:
	> *"A non-radial pulsation means that the star is not pulsating in spherical symmetry -- different parts of the star's surface are moving in and out at different times, and the shape of the surface depends upon the type of mode that's pulsating.  Since different parts of the star are moving in different directions at different speeds, and this may appear in a spectrum of the star as asymmetries in absorption line profiles.  An absorption line in a stationary gas will have a line profile that is similar to a Gaussian -- symmetric, with one central peak.  But if different parts of the star are moving at different speeds relative to our line of sight, then each parcel of gas will have its own red- or blue-shifted line profile resulting in a single line profile with waves and bumps.  These features may also shift around in wavelength if the star is rotating.  Careful analysis of the changes in line profile with time may reveal the presence of non-radial modes, or it may eliminate the possibility."* - [AAVSO RR Lyrae](https://www.aavso.org/vsots_rrlyr)
