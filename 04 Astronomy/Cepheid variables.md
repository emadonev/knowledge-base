These types of [[Variable stars]] pulsate in a steady, repeating cycle, and they are typically yellow supergiants. Their period is from 1 to 70 days or 1 to 100 days, with an amplitude from 0.1 to 2.0 magnitudes difference. They are very massive stars, and they are candles in the universe for calculating distance since they are as steady as a heartbeat. They are approximatively 6 times the mass of [[The Sun]], and have a radius around 25 times that of the Sun.

They exhibit a relationship called the [[Period-luminosity relationship]], where the period is directly tied to the luminosity. There are 2 subtypes of cepheids:
1. Classical Cepheids or **Delta Cepheids**: 4-20 times more massive than the Sun, O-B type stars

2. **Type II Cepheids**: less massive and older than delta cepheids ([[Population II type stars]]), 1-50 days period or 1-100 periods, O-B type stars. It is super important to note that these types of cepheid stars follow a **different [[Period-luminosity relationship]]!**


The [[Pulsation principles of stars]] in cepheids is valid, with the ionization of He+ into He++, which causes changes in temperature, radius, pressure and the radial pulsation can be spotted with [[The Doppler effect]]. This is why as well as the change in magnitude over time, we can track the temperature, radius and radial velocity.
