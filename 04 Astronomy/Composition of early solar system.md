### Planets
In the close clutches of our star, the heat was so high, no large quantity of gases remained to form gas planets. And so, the first four planets are terrestrial, bound to their fate by our sun. Inside their interior, they contain spherical layers which were created by the melting of metal. 
At the beginning, the decay of radioactive isotopes and the energy from the collisions of different planetesimals to form the terrestrial planets heated the planet, starting the proces called **gravitational separation.** Each metal or CAI being of different density, the layers moved and assembled themselves in a density gradient or gravitational gradient. The heaviest metals sank to the heart of the planet, while the light metals formed the outer layers, shielding the planet's interior. 

Farther away, beyond the ice line, the gas giants formed. Because the density of gas and dust was much larger in the area of Jupiter, the density decreased as we went outwards, towards space. This meant that Jupiter and Saturn are larger than Neptune and Uranus. 

### Small bodies of the solar system
In the inner part of the solar system, all the moons are rocky in composition, and as we go further out they become increasingly icy. First come water-ice bodies and later nitrogen-ice bodies as the temperatures drop substantially. 

Using all of this evidence of the composition of planets, it is theorized that there exists a **temperature gradient in the solar system.**

There are 3 possible ways that grains or chondrules can interract in a collision:
1. one or both particles can fragment
2. they can go their separate ways (collision in opposite directions as a result)
3. ==sticking together==
