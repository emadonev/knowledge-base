- cooled remnant of an ancient universe: the first light ever
- made very soon after the big bang
- today we detect this background radiation in the microwave part of the spectrum
- it was discovered 1965
	- Penzias and Wilson (radio astronomers) registered a signal to their radio telescope and could not pinpoint the source
	- it came from everywhere, at all times
	- solid evidence of [[The big bang theory]]
- first light came from 380000 years after the big bang when the universe cooled down enough
- the farthest we can look back because there was no light before!
- since the universe stretched, the light stretched also so now it is in the microwave part of the spectrum
- currently it is only 2.725 degrees above absolute zero, which is extremely cold!
- *"According to NASA, CMB fills the universe and in the days before cable TV every household with television could seeÂ (https://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/starsgalaxies/cobe_background.html). By turning the television to an "in-between" channel, you could see the CMB as a static signal on the screen."*

- *"By studying these fluctuations, cosmologists can learn about the origin of galaxies and large-scale structures of galaxies and they can measure the basic parameters of the Big Bang theory," NASA wrote*
- PLANK: an ESA observatory in space covering the far infrared, microwave and high frequency radio waves
	- it observes the CMB
	- WMAP (NASA's telescope) managed to establish [[The standard model of cosmology]]
- every tiny fluctuation in temperature shows a possible place where the area was more dense, and hence the birth place of galaxies and stars
