Dark energy is energy which accelerates the expansion of the universe. It is commonly known that the universe started with the Big Bang, and since then it has been expanding. However, scientists thought it was expanding uniformly until the Hubble Space Telescope discovered that in the earlier stages of the universe it was expanding slower than today.

Dark energy is the opposing force of gravity. While gravity acts on smaller scales and distances, dark energy acts on the fabric of space-time and beats gravity, and in doing so accelerates the expansion of the universe. Objects that are further away from us are expanding faster than objects closer to us. Currently, 68 %-72 % of the universe is dark energy.

Evidence for dark energy are supernovas. Scientists use standard candle supernovas to determine the Hubble constant, or the rate of the expansion of the universe. In doing so, they discovered that the further supernovas exploded earlier than expected. This means they are more distant than they "should" be, implying the existence of something accelerating the expansion.

While we can never observe dark energy directly and we currently barely know anything about it, scientists are hoping that they will find more evidence and find a way to figure out dark energy.
