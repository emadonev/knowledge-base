These are [[Variable stars]] which are dwarf [[Cepheid variables]], where the [[Luminosity]] varies from less than 1% to more than 100%! These are super fluctuating variables. They are A-F type stars. The period is from around 0.01 to 0.2 days! Suuuper fast! These are the most common pulsating stars found in the universe, and they are well understood. Lots of these stars are multi-periodic, meaning they pulsate in a number of different ways, resulting in various period times. This makes determining their periods via [[Analyzing light curves]] super challenging. DSCT's which have a greater amplitude of magnitude (larger than 0.2) are called High amplitude Delta Scutis or **HADS**.
