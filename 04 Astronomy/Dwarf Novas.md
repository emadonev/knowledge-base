These dwarf novas have a similar setup to [[Novas]], with a white dwarf and a companion star. The white dwarf accretes the material, but it forms a disk around itself. And here, it is the disk which undergoes a nuclear reaction and ignites, rather than the dwarf. This burst is usually much smaller in magnitude compared to [[Supernova]]s or [[Novas]]. 

### U Geminorum
U Geminorum are a sub-class of dwarf novae, these systems are much closer than regular dwarf novas!

### Z camelopardalis stars
Eruptions occur at intervals of 10 to 30 days, where sometimes these stars are at **stillstands or standstills.** These are the periods where the brightness does not change for a VERY long time before returning to the eruptions!

### SU Ursae Majoris stars
Very short orbital periods, typically less than 2 hours! They have 2 different kinds of outbursts: a short one, which lasts a few days, and a *superoutburst* which is long, and has a 10-20 long duration. The smaller the outburst, the more frequent it is.

### SS Cygni stars
These types of stars increase in magnitude by 2 till 6, and return to their origigi brightness within a few days. They repeat this brightening then fading every few days, or even every few years!

### WZ Sagittae stars
These stars have an extremely short period (around 90 minutes!) and they have superoutbursts. After a superoutburst, they cool off on the brightness for a few years or even decades. These outbursts can sometimes be even brighter than supernovae!!

A note: these stars also exhibit echo outbursts, where the brightness briefly increases and decreases on its slow decline back to the original state.
