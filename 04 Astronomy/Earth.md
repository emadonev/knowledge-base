The Earth is our home planet, one that has been around for 4.6 billion years. In studying our planet, we gain the resources to study other planets in [[The solar system]], and also planets far, far away, [[Exoplanets]].

# History of the Earth
---
How did the Earth form? Well, it started to form along with the other planets in the [[Protoplanetary disks]] of our future solar system. Little pieces of dust and pebbles started to stick together, more and more to form a small mass which kept growing. The kinetic energy of the particles sticking together heated this small mass, and with radiation from various elements our planet had a molten core.

As time passed, inner layers differentiated, where in the centre there are the heaviest elements, and as we go to the surface lighter elements persist. However, part of our core still remained molten, which enabled the **dynamo process** due to the rotation of the Earth. The magnetic field is created by electrical current flowing through the fluid, which amplify the field, etc. 

**Volcanos** were crucial to the evolution of Earth, as they released tons of carbon dioxide, methane and water vapor, forming a rudimentary atmosphere. As temperatures got lower, water started to condense on the surface, absorbing lots of carbon dioxide with the help of other compounds from sedimentary rocks. the removal of carbon dioxide gave way to a life-offering planetary atmosphere.

## How do we know how old the Earth is?
---
Through **radioactive dating**. If we take an [[Isotopes]] which we want to compare the life-time of Earth with, we need to choose an appropriate **half-life**, and compare the current amount of isotopes with the estimate of how many were present. 
- f $$N(t) = N_0\frac{1}{2}^{t/\tau_{1/2}}$$

## Plate tectonics
---
Due to radioactive decay below the thin crust of the Earth, it keeps the crust not fully molten, but a bit sludgy so we can have **tectonic plates**. The layer of crust above the sludge part is the **lithosphere**, made up of plates. 

Plates enable many geological processes which shape our planet and give rise to various geological shapes of landscapes, enabling various ecosystems for the biodiversity of Earth.


# Chaos theory and the Earth

>*“They have also shown that the Moon’s tides stabilise the Earth against influences that would otherwise lead to chaotic motion, causing rapid shifts of climate from warm periods to ice ages and back again. So chaos theory demonstrates that, without the Moon, the Earth would be a pretty unpleasant place to live. ”

Seventeen Equations that Changed the World
Ian Stewart*

>But a year later, a model, devised by Jacques Laskar suggested that the same holds true for the entire solar system. In Laskar's model an error of 15 metres in the initial location of the Earth grows into an error of 150 metres after ten million years, and then into a huge error of 150 million kilometres after 100 million years.
