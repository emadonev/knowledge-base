- one of the stars in a double or [[Binary star system]] partially blocks the light of its companion as it passes in front. The brightness fluctuates every time, and we see the large dip in brightness due to one of them being variable, and a small dip when the companion wizzes by. The change in luminosity depends on the brightness of the 2 stars, how far away they are from each other, their geometry viewed from Earth.

There are a few observations we can make about eclipsing binaries:
1. If the two dips are not equal in size, it means that the 2 stars have different surface areas. The deeper dip is when the hotter star passes in front of the cool star
2. If the system is directly head on, the dips will be flat at the bottom. 
3. If the dips are brief and sharp it means that the stars are relatively far away compared to their size.
4. If the dips are long and flat it means that the stars are relatively close compared to their size.

Of course, there are different types of eclipsing binaries!
- [[Algol variables]]
- [[Beta Lyrae variables (EB)]]
- [[W Ursae Majoris variables (EW)]]
