The reason why older stars pulsate is because they have already burned up their hydrogen and have now started using **helium**, which is crucial for the eddington valve. 

Doubly ionized helium is more opaque, and the radiation from the core cannot escape efficiently the helium absorbes this energy and heats up. The extra heat creates more ionized helium atoms. At the dimmest period of the cycle, the outer ionized layers begins to expand because it is hotter. As it expands it starts to cool, becoming less ionized and less transparent, allowing light to escape again! The contraction starts, and then the process repeats!
