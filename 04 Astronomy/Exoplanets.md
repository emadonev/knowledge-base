# Detection
-----
We can detect exoplanets using the advantage of their [[Planetary orbits]]. When a planet orbits a star, they both orbit the ==centre of mass==. So, when that happens, we need to combine ==radial [[Velocity]]== and ==transverse velocity==.

We can break down the total velocity of a moving star by breaking down the individual velocity [[Vectors]].

So, by using vector addition, we can combine radial and transverse velocity in order to get the total velocity. We can apply this concept in exoplanet hunting.

We can then see that the star would constantly shift in the spectrum of [[Light]], successfully creating [[The Doppler effect]]! We can use this effect to detect ==exoplanets using the radial velocity of stars!==

From these insights we can make a **radial-velocity plot** or a RV plot. Here is an example of this plot:
![[RV plot.png]]
There are a few notes here:
- ! Note 1: This graph only shows the ==radial velocity==, not the ==total velocity==. 
- ! Note 2: Zero radial velocity doesn't mean the object isn't moving! it means that at that point the velocity is entirely transverse.
- ! Note 3: the curve here is ==fitted==, it is not an actual curve representing the data: it is the best fit!

By using the RV plot we can detect exoplanets! If we have a small perturbation in the radial velocity of stars, it is most likely a planet and we can determine the ==period and mass== of the exoplanet. 

### Determining the planet's properties
-----
The period is the timeframe from one peak or trough of the graph to the next! We can also determine the distance from the planet to the star very simply using [[Kepler's laws]], or more precisely Kepler's third law of motion. 

If we then calculate the orbital velocity of the planet, the star and we know the mass of the star, we can calculate the mass of the planet using the ==Law of conservation of [[Momentum]]==. However, we might not be viewing the planet head on, and there might be an ==inclination== of the planet's orbit. So, $$M_{actual} = \frac{M_{inferred}}{sin \; i}$$
Where $i$ is the inclination angle.
