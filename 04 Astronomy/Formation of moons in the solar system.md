We know that the Moon formed when another rocky planet collided with the Earth, ripped out a large chunk, and that chunk became the moon. The other planet was blown to smithereens, and became part of the asteroid club. 

But the Moon isnt the only moon in the solar system. The gas giants captured bodies passing by and taking them in as their own. Some moons form in an accretion disk around their parent planet. And some planetesimals crash into another and form moons, like our Moon formed.
