The formation of planets was thought to have been known, however, scientists are now showing that we have to abandon all of our previously known models.

Formation of planets is becoming **chaotic**, hence it is becoming part of [[Chaos theory]]!

The original model was the [[The core accretion model]], using small clumps of mass.

The original clumps of mass are called planetesimals, and it was thought that they were just sort of there and later accumulated more mass. 

It was thought that these ready made planetesimals were distributed across the solar system (or solar nebula) by the ==power law==. It states that there are more small planetesimals than large ones and that they are distributed as such. 

Because if ALMA [[The solar system]] and other planetary systems cannot form with [[The core accretion model]] because it simply isn't correct anymore. 

There were probably specific areas in a nebula where embryos of planets formed, like a small difference in density or materials available. 

All in all, scientists think that it will take a few decades to fully understand the formation of our solar system and the formation of other planetary systems.

It is currently a debate wether the migration of Jupiter and Saturn provoked the existence of terrestrial planets, or hindered the growth of more planets.
