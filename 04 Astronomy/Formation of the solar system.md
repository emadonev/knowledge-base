It all started around 4.6 billion years ago. A large, dense cloud of gas and dust made of hydrogen, helium and other heavier elements used to be in the area we now call the solar system. Somwehere, far away, a [[Supernova]] exploded and sent a harsh shockwave rippling through the universe. After a long time traveling, it reached our humble little cloud and caused its inevitable collapse, bringing along with it lots of materials before unabailable in the molecular cloud. The gas started falling in on itself, gravity crushing it tighter and tighter together, eventually forming a [[Solar nebula]]. As the nebula contained angular momentum, a spinning disk of gas and dust formed around the center. Gravity kept crushing the core, the heart of the nebula. Eventually, the pressure became to great, and hydrogen atoms fused together for the first time ever, eventually forming helium. The fusion released an enourmous amount of energy. Like a baby taking its first breath, a star is born. And with its first exhale, it blew away all of the gas and dust in the solar system not lucky enough to be a part of a planet or moon with a powerful [[Solar wind]]. This theory is often called the **nebula hypothesis** and it was developed by scientist Pierre-Simon Laplace. 

Multiple model exist on how the planets formed. [[The core accretion model]] and the [[Pebble accretion]] model and [[The disk instability model]] are the most famous and popular ones. An interesting idea about planet formation is that large interstellar objects which pass by in the solar system can cause disturbances in the [[Protoplanetary disks]] hence causing planet formation. Another model is [[Gravitational isntabillity model]], which is quite similar (the same) as the disk instabillity model.

ALMA ruined everything. Everything we thought we knew, we dont know anymore. Scientists are constantly developing new theories for explaining terrestrial planet formation, which is currently unexplainable by the [[Pebble accretion]] model, because evidence suggests that the Earth formed over a long period of time due to its chemical composition. 

While the planets formed, some migrated, and thus forming the [[Planetary migration in the solar system]]. This enabled the look of our solar system today, and may explain why some planets formed where they did.

A new study shows that magnetism might be a key component in the formation of the planets in the early solar system. Discovering this was extremely difficult partly because magnetism is very hard and difficult to apply in planetary formation. The effects of magnetism, run with a supercomputer in Europe, seem to be:
1. They shield certain clumps of gas, those that later become planets, from solar radiation
2. They slow down the growth of what would become supermassive planets, stopping the infall of new matter
3. Finally, magnetic fields can disrupt gas, either disintegrating protoplanetary clumps or it pushes gas together starting planet formation.

Clues about the formation of the solar system
1. All of the planets are in the same orbital plane and orbit in the same direction
	-> CONCLUSION: a spinning disk of material
2. Location and size of the planets
	-> CONCLUSION: metals were available in the inner solar system, while ices and gases in the outer solar system. Gas giants formed faster, especially Jupiter and Saturn. Uranus and Neptune are not as large because they are further out and the material density is smaller.
3. Architecture of the solar system
4. The presence of asteroids, comets, and Kupier belt objects
	-> CONCLUSION: they show us the building blocks of the universe, and we have the asteroid belt becuse Jupiter disrupted the whole thing because it migrated inward. 
5. Interior structure of planets
	-> Because of the interactions of the planets, they melted the inner cores of terrestrial planets forming the layered [[Composition of early solar system]]. 
6. Moon systems
7. Signs of collision

While at the beginning some people thought that the solar system formed via a catastrophe, as a star knocking into our sun, it is today shown that it formed **evolutionarilly** as a gradual process.
