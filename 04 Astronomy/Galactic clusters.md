While [[Galaxies]] may seem like loners, our own galaxy, [[the Milky Way]] is part of a family called the **local Group**. Its not a large family, but family sticks together. 

**Clusters** of galaxies provide an interesting way of analyzing galaxy evolution, how they form, and how they interact with one another. Other clusters, besides our own, are the *Virgo, Coma, Hercules and Coma clusters.*

# The inner workings of clusters
---
By using the same analogy as in [[Star clusters]], we can assume that galactic clusters are also **dynamically relaxed**, which is confirmed by the fact that the number of galaxies per unit area fall of at approximately:
- f $$\exp[-(r/r_0)^{1/4}]$$
Which is the same for luminosity in elliptical galaxies, which are confirmed dynamically relaxed systems. 

The time it takes for a cluster to pass from one end of a cluster to the other is called **crossing time**, and its just a simple relationship between time, speed and distance. Since the time it takes for a galaxy to cross a cluster is approximately $10^9$ years, and we think that they are old around $10^{10}$ years, which means that clusters have to be **gravitationally bound** - and thus we have all the grounds for the [[Virial theorem]]. In terms of internal motions, the virial mass is, as was for any cluster:

- f $$M = \frac{5⟨v^2⟩R}{3G}$$, or in terms of the Doppler effect: $$M = \frac{5⟨v_r^2⟩R}{G}$$

The motions of galaxies within a cluster are described as such:
![[motion within a cluster galaxy.png|300]]

However, there was a slight issue. The added luminous mass of all the galaxies doesn't add up to the virial mass. This once again indicates the presence of **dark matter**. Another problem is that not even the extra mass from dark matter adds up to the virial mass. So, what does? It has been suspected that intergalactic gas could help, but it still isn't enough. 

Now, researchers think that galaxies extend much farther than expected or that *clusters themselves have their own dark matter.*

Going back to the structure of clusters, it has been shown that large elliptical galaxies are always found near the centre of these galactic clusters, and they are called *central dominant or cD galaxies.* 

## Galactic interactions
---
There are a few ways galaxies interact, which is still a super active area of research, as we don't really get a lot of action. Galaxies can pass by each other, but inflict enormous tidal forces on each other, causing severe distortions. Other large galaxies eat smaller ones, being **galactic cannibals**, and thus containing multiple nuclei. Or, the fate of our own Milky way and the Andromeda galaxy - they are going to one day **merge** into Milkdromeda, otherwise known as **galaxy mergers**. These interactions help us learn more about galactic evolution and formation. 

# The universe is expanding!
---
Back in 1924, when Edwin Hubble discovered that we aren't the only galaxy in the universe, he also discovered that **every other galaxy was moving away from us**, they had a **red doppler shift.** This meant that ==the universe is expanding!== He developed a simple law relating a galaxies speed with its distance from us:
- f Hubble's law:$$v = H_0\;d$$, where $v$ is the velocity of the galaxy, $d$ is the distance away from us and $H_0$ is the Hubble constant - constant in space **for a certain timeframe.**

![[hubbles "constant".png|300]]
- n Here we can see the variability of the Hubble constant depending on which type of object we are looking at, since their velocities depend on light, we look at *each object at a particular time in the past, so the Hubble constant changes a lot*. 

So, the universe is expanding like a ballon, where every galaxy is moving away from every other galaxy,
![[expansion of the universe.png|300]]

If we say that every galaxy has been "travelling" from the beginning of time, $t=0$, to now:$$d = vt_0$$, then $$v = \frac{1}{t_0}d$$, or the genius form:
- f $$H_0 = \frac{1}{t_0}$$

But, this only works if ==the expansion of the universe has been constant==. 

We can use Hubble's law to measure the distance of faraway objects, whose velocities relative to us are dominated buy the expansion of the universe, or in other words, *objects must be far enough away to be in the Hubble flow. Objects within our own cluster of galaxies are not in the Hubble flow - their motions are dominated by the dynamics of our cluster.*

More about this in [[Calculating distances in astronomy]]. 

# Super super clusters!
---
In 1950 we got the first evidence of the existence of **superclusters** - a group of galactic clusters, spanning an enormous region of space with tons of galaxies. They are a bit hard to observe as the galaxies themselves are really far away, but we make do. 

- n We cannot use the virial theorem for superclusters to determine their mass, as they aren't dynamically relaxed, and we aren't even sure if they are gravitationally bound. 

Even though they are filled with galaxies, there is tons of space left empty, called **voids.** Galaxies are distributed in extremely complicated shapes, difficult to even model or mathematically describe.

We can also study the general motion of each cluster using our relative motion against the sky, and calibrating for Earth's and the Sun's motion. We get that most of our clusters, including our local group and the virgo cluster are moving quite fast towards some unknown location, called the **great attractor.**

# But, how?
---
We actually don't know. We don't have enough data to really see how everything formed. We don't know if galaxies formed first and then grouped into clusters, or if all of these clouds were present and then differentiated into everything we see today. An enormous problem is **dark matter**. It makes up a huge amount of matter in the universe, and we have no clue what it is. Since we can't take it into account, creating a simulation to model the universe is impossible. We will discuss this more in [[Cosmology]].
