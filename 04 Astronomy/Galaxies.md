Back in the 20th century, the greatest minds of our time were discussing if other "spiral nebulae" were part of our galaxy or other galaxies. The discussion was settled when Edwin Hubble proved that nebulas like the Andromeda galaxy were too far away to be part of our own galaxy - he is the **founder of extragalactic astronomy.**

There are lots of different types of galaxies, each with their own shape, properties and such. Hubble invented his visual scheme for categorizing these galaxies.

## Round an ellipse

- eg **Elliptical galaxies** - E0 - E7, ranging in their eccentricity

These galaxies range from the super small **dwarf ellipticals**, only a few kpc across, to **giant ellipticals**, around 100 kpc across. They range in eccentricity, or how elliptical they are. 

Ellipticals have low gas content and low star formation. We think that this is because there are no young stars present, and they seem to have a very evolved stellar population. The problem is that **metallicity is high.** Another thing is that they rotate quite slowly. 

We can describe the light from most ellipticals follows **Vaucouleur's law**
- f $$L(r) = L(0)e^{-(r/r_0)^{1/4}}$$, where $L(0)$ and $r_0$ are constants. $L(0)$ is typically known to be $2* 10^5 L_s/pc^2$. 

- n Some elliptical galaxies are:
	- n M87, Virgo (E0)
	- n M49, Virgo (E1)
	- n M32, Andromeda (E2)

## Spirals all the way down
---
- eg **Spiral galaxies** - divided into categories Sa, Sb and Sc, depending on how open or tight their spiral pattern is, and how bright their central bulge is. *Sa - tight, brightest bulge*, *Sc - open arms, smallest bulge*.
- eg **Barred spiral galaxies** - divided into categories SBa, SBb, SBc, depending on the tightness and brightness (same as for spirals).
- eg We differentiate 2 types of spirals - **grand design spiral**, very visible very sharp spirals, and **flocculent spirals** - smudged, not as sharp spirals.

Spiral galaxies make up 2/3 of our total galactic knowledge. In [[Galactic clusters]], their main constituent are ellipticals (80%), but outside clusters spirals are present in 80% of the time. 

Since spirals vary quite a bit in luminosity, we also added a **luminosity scale** from I to V (same as for [[Stars]]) along with the visual type. We can quantify the change in luminosity as we go further away from the centre:
- f $$L(r) = L_0\;e^{-r/D}$$, where $D$ is the luminosity scale length (measure of the characteristic radius of the galaxy seen in visible light) - typical values around 5 kpc. 

Spirals have tons of gas and dust, and have plentiful star formation. 

To summarize the properties of ellipticals and spirals, here is a table:

## Other types of galaxies

#### 01 S0 type
This is a peculiar type of galaxy, where the bulge practically overtakes the entire contents of a galaxy. They have no detectable gas, and we don't really know all that much about them.
![[S0 type.png|200]]

#### 02 Irregulars
Galaxies with no particular shape of form are of course called irregular galaxies. A very famous example are *the Magellanic clouds.* 

We divide them into 2 types:
1. **Irr I** are resolved into stars and nebulae
2. **Irr II** don't really have some defined appearance, they are amorphous. 

#### 03 Others of the others
- eg **Ring galaxies** - have a cool ring around their centre
- eg **Lenticular galaxies** - irregular elongated structure
- eg **Peculiar galaxies** - contain a general overall pattern, but contain irregular structures with suspicious activity

And finally, we have [[Active galaxies]], which is discussed in more detail there. 

# Star formation in various galaxies
---
A super important part of galactic analysis is looking into where stars form in different types of galaxies. 

In irregular galaxies, like the LMC, we see **enormous molecular clouds and $HII$ regions**, just like in [[the Milky Way]]. There are small bunches of nebulas where there is intense star formation, but with a high abundance of $CO$ and other molecules make star formation very abundant.

By studying spiral galaxies, we see that most star formation goes on in the arms of spiral galaxies, where there are the most $HII$ regions. However, we don't understand massive star formation and molecular clouds well enough to form a good understanding of galaxies. Hydrogen quantities vary from galaxy to galaxy, where some's interstellar medium is 50% hydrogen, others with 10%, but stars still present in them all.

# Where do spirals come from?
---
Spiral galaxies are beautiful to look at, but how did their spirals form? We covered the rotation curve for [[the Milky Way]], which means that *differential rotation should have smeared out any pattern.* And yet, it hasn't. Actually, differential rotation could be responsible for the formation of spiral arms, in the short term, as they would constantly change. ![[spiral arms short term.png|200]]
The differential rotation starts moving the stars into a spiral pattern, but after some time those particular stars move out of sync and the pattern is lost. **However**, with the help of the ==galactic halo==, it creates a **density wave.** This wave dictates a speed around which the stars in the disk have to move at, providing a spiral shape which can last for a long while, before regenerating into a new pattern. 

> In the density wave picture, the visible arms are a result of a gathering of interstellar matter. When high enough densities are reached, star formation may take place.

The movement of $HI$ and $HII$ regions in space with the spiral arms causes them to try and overtake the spiral pattern, which increase the pressure, forming stars and then dissipating. It's actually quite genius. 

> According to this picture, giant molecular clouds should be seen almost exclusively in spiral arms.

# Accept the dark
---
When we discussed rotational curves for [[the Milky Way]], we realized that the further away we went from the centre of the galaxy, the **velocity didn't slow down** from measurements of the doppler shift in $H\alpha$ lines. This is an issue, as it proves that **there must be some matter which doesn't give off luminosity**, since more mass means that the velocity stays constant. 

- n This research was done by **Vera Rubin**, an amazing woman who pioneered extragalactic research and proved the existence of dark matter.

Researchers are now looking into where is the dark matter hiding. The disk is not very likely, as that much mass in the disk would render it unstable. However, if it were in the halo, it would be a spherically symmetric mass distribution, allowing it to stay stable. Using:$$\frac{GM(r)}{r^2} = \frac{v^2(r)}{r}$$,and rewriting for $M(r)$:$$M(r) = \frac{rv^2(r)}{G}$$
We can relate mass to density, where $dM/dr = 4\pi r^2 \rho(r)$. Then:$$\rho(r) = \frac{dM(r)}{4\pi r^2 \;dr}$$
Substituting this back in and saying that the velocity is constant, then:
- f $$\rho(r) = \frac{v_0^2}{4\pi Gr^2}$$

There is unfortunately not much progress in **what** dark matter is really. Particles like MACHO, WIMPs, neutrinos, etc. have been tried to fit into the picture, but nothing really worked until now. More research simply has to be done.
