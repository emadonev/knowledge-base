Gamma rays are the most energetic form of wavelength of light from the [[Electromagnetic spectrum (EM)]], and so the [[Telescopes]] for detecting them need to be in space, however! We can indirectly observe gamma rays from the ground, since high energy photons collide with molecules in the atmosphere, new particles are created and they emit [[Cherenkov radiation]] which we can detect.

An example of a observatory based on this principle is the Milagro Gamma Ray observatory.

Other than this, gamma ray telescopes are in space and they observe various parts of the sky, with the first satellite from the 1960s, OSO 3. We use **scintillation detectors inside of them** and they convert photons into moving electrons by using photomultipliers. ([[Detectors and instruments]])
