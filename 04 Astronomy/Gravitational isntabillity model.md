A model for the formation of planets in a similar manner to star formation: denser areas in the protoplanetary disk collapse under their own weight, forming tiny cores which accumulate mass, later forming larger cores and eventually the planets. 

While this model is simple in theory, some details make it an unattractive model. It would take too long for Uranus and Neptune to form before the nebula was depleted by solar winds. This method also does not explain the small bodies of the solar system! It does not take into account the varying densities of planets, mass distribution and the correlation between metallicity and planet formation.
