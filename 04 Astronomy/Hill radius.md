The distance from a planetesimal where the orbital period of a particle around the planetesimal is equal to the orbital period of the planetesimal around its star. It is defined as $R_h$. 

Assuming a circular orbit, and that the mass of the particle is much much smaller than the planetesimal ($M >> m$), the orbital period at a distance $R$ is given by Kepler's third law:

(1)
$$
P ≃ 2π\sqrt{\frac{R^3}{GM}}
$$

(2) The equality of the orbital periods
$$
\sqrt{\frac{a^3}{M_o}} = \sqrt{\frac{{R_h}^3}{M}}
$$

(3) The final equation
$$
R_h = (\frac{M}{M_o})^{\frac{1}{3}} a
$$
If the particle comes within one Hill radius and the relative velocity is small enough, the particle becomes part of the planetesimal. As the planetesimal grows into a planet, its Hill Radius grows. The planet stops growing when no particles can be found within the Hill radius, or when the gas and dust is depleted.
