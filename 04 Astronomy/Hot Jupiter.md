Hot Jupiters are a type of exoplanet which is the size of around Jupiter, or these planets are gas giants. However, rather than being beyond the ice line, these gasy planets are found in the close clutches of their host stars, having orbits of only a few days. These worlds are extremely hot and large, making them very strange.

Scientists believe that they must have formed in the outer regions of the planetary system, but later migrated inwards and simply stayed there, becoming hot Jupiters. This is reminiscient of [[The grand track]], however, Hot Juptiers did not have a Saturn to stop them!
