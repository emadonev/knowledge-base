It is common knowledge that the universe is expanding, at an ever increasing rate since the beginning, according to  [[The big bang theory]]. However, how fast is it really expanding?

Astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered the rate of expansion using his law by studying [[The Doppler effect]] of galaxies in the universe. His law states that:
- !! $$v = H_0\;d$$, where v is the speed of the galaxy, d is the distance, and $H_0$ is Hubble's constant. 

We can approximate the universe as a giant sphere where everything is expanding away from everything, so the further away objects are, the faster they seem to be expanding. However, if we assume the rate of expansion to be the same, we can say that:$$d = vt_0$$, where $t_0$ is the age of the universe. So, $$v = \frac{d}{t_0}$$Since both are the same as Hubble's law, we get that
- !! $$H_0 = \frac{1}{t_0}$$, where $1/H_0$ is referred to as **Hubble time*, the age of the universe if the expansion has been constant. *

However, if we look at different clusters and measure their distances and such, we find that the Hubble constant **ranges** from 50 to 100 km/s/Mpc. The problem is that we need to determine the distance of objects in a way which doesn't involve Hubble, and we need to make sure that they aren't to close or in the **Hubble flow.**
- n This means that the [[Velocity]] of the objects should be far less than the velocity they gain by the expansion of the universe. If objects are too close, they might be in the Hubble flow, so they are inaccurate.
