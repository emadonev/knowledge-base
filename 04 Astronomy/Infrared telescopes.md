Infrared [[Telescopes]] have their challenges, the main one being that most objects peak in the infrared, so it is hard to focus on the sky and on a particular object. A solution is to cool objects around the telescope so that they minimize the effect, but its not just the cold. The **atmosphere** represents a big problem, as it blocks a lot of infrared light. A very important part of the spectrum is the **near-infrared**, which includes wavelengths below 5 m. 

However, infrared telescopes are extremely useful for looking at [[Exoplanets]] and especially [[Protoplanetary disks]], which are usually obscured by the cold gas, but with infrared we can see their structure much better. Some examples of infrared telescopes are:
- KAO, a plane for the spectrum
- SOFIA
- IRAS and ISO

A difficult notion for infrared telescopes is the fact that **infrared cannot penetrate glass**, so we use reflectors to focus infrared light, by using an oscillating secondary mirror to differentiate between the object and the background.
