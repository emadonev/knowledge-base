The Julian Date is traditionally the interval of time between noon at Greenwich on January 1st 4713 BC till today. This avoids the complexity of calendar systems and allows us to precisely measure star times and [[Variable stars]] periods. 

There is a slight correction though: because our [[Earth]] orbits [[The Sun]], the light from a variable star might come slightly early or slightly later than usual. This is why we use the heliocentric correction HC as follows:
$$
HC = -0.0057Rcos(ß)cos(L-λ)
$$
Where $R$ is the distance between the Earth and Sun in AU, $ß$ and $λ$ are the ecliptic latitude and longitude of the star, and $L$ is the ecliptic longitude of the Sun. (REFERENCE TO [[Ecliptic coordinate system]]). We also have the modified Julian Date:$$Modified Julian Date = Julian Date − 240 0000·5 days.$$
