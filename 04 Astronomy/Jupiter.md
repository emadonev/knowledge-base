Why is Jupiter so much more massive than any other planet? Because ice and gases were present further away from the Sun, beyond the **frost line**. A dense area formed just beyond the forst line, where matter could very quickly clump together ([[Pebble accretion]]) Jupiter. This might be why Saturn has so much less mass, becase Jupiter ate away everything before Saturn could form.
