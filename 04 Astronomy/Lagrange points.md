Using [[Newtonian mechanics]] and [[The universal law of gravitation]], as well as other things like [[Kepler's laws]] and [[Elementary planetary motion]], we can see that for a **multibody system**, the following equation of motion holds:
- f $$\vec{a_k} = \sum_{i=1, i \not= k}^{i=n} Gm_i \frac{\vec{r_1}-\vec{r_k}}{|\vec{r_i} - \vec{r_k}|^3}$$

In [[The solar system]] we restrict the motion of the planets to **two body problems**, as the effects of the other planets are too insignificant to notice. However, there is a problem, called the **restricted three body problem**, where we have 2 massive objects orbiting one another, kind of like a [[Binary star system]], and a third *extremely tiny* object is moving with them, not disturbing their path. The job is to find the orbit of that third object, which proved to be more difficult than expected. 

>**The points at which this third body ==rests relative to the other 2 main bodies== are called *Lagrange points.***

Points $L_1, L_2, L_3$ are on the same path, while $L_4, L_5$ form 2 **equilateral triangles** with the other body. Here we can find [[Asteroids]] and other interesting mechanics problems :)
