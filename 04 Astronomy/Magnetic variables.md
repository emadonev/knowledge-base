These stars have super strong magnetic fields. These fields are the cause of their variability, and there are a few ways to go about this:
1. creation of star spots: these spots are cooler and darker, and as the star rotates they cause changes in brightness
2. when the magnetic field interacts with the stellar or [[Solar wind]]. Once these two collide, particles will suddenly start emitting light due to the influence of the magnetic field, changing the output brightness of the star. 

There are more types of magnetic variables.

## DG Herculis stars: intermediate polars
These stars are part of a [[Binary star system]]]] where one is a low-mass star, and the other is a [[White dwarf]]. As an accretion disk around the white dwarf forms, it is disrupted close around the white dwarf due to an extremely strong magnetic field.

## AM Her stars: polars
These stars have the same binary star system as the previous type, but here the magnetic field is soo strong that accretion disks cannot form! The stars are tidally locked, spinning at the same speed around each other. The streams of matter go towards the poles of the white dwarf, slamming into it at speeds of 3000 km/s, which causes a large X-ray shock. This, coupled with the two maxima and two minima of brightness of the second star due to its shape, is the reason for its variability.
