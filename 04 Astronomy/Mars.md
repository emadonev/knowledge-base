A small rocky planet located in 4th place in [[The solar system]]. It is between the [[Earth]] and the [[Asteroids]]. 

The size of Mars is an interesting aspect. Some models say that Jupiter and Saturn were once much closer as with the rest of the gas giants, and so consumed lots of material, due to their migration in [[The Nice model]] or [[The grand track]]. Once they migrated outwards and Mars was forming, it simply had a lack of materials. Another model says that Jupiters gravity might have cut off the flow of material towards Mars, making it so small.
