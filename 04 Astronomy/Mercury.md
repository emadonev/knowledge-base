Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, and it has an orbital period of 88 days, and rotates in 59 days. Its interesting, since Mercury has a rather eccentric orbit with strong tide effects from the Sun, causing a 2/3 ratio between rotation and revolution, which scientists didn't detect for a long time. The only spacecraft to make a flyby around Mercury is **Mariner 10.**
