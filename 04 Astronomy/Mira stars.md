These variables are red giants with a period from 80 to 1000 days. They have large amplitude swings, always more than 2.5 magnitude changes, up to 1000 during a cycle! These stars are massive, and when they pulsate, their whole size expands. While pulsating they tend to eject materials into space, and this mass loss might have some serious consequences for their future.

Why is the amplitude change so large for mira variables? Mira stars are very old and highly evolved, being the largest, coolest and most luminous of the red giants. As the star becomes fainter, it cools down and since there is less thermal energy, it is less bright (less [[Photons]] are released in the visible part of the spectrum.) A special thing about Mira variables is that when they cool they form $TiO$ molecules which are very good at absorbing all of the light coming from the star, making it appear even dimmer.
