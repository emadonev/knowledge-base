There were a few models of the solar system during the past. The first one is ==Aristotle's model== of [[The solar system]]. It was a **geocentric model**, meaning that the [[Earth]] was in the centre, and everything else, including  [[The Sun]] orbited around it. However, he knew that the Earth was spherical! How?

### How did we determine the shape of the Earth?

Aristarchus determined the shape of the Earth with the help of a lunar eclipse. He showed that since the shadow of the Earth on the moon was spherical, the Earth itself must be also.

Another piece of evidence was the fact that different constellations at different latitudes infer that the Earth has to be spherical. 

Aristarchus took this knowledge of the spherity of the Earth and decided to calculate some things.

Mainly, he wanted to discover the relative sizes of the Earth and Moon, as well as their respective distances from each other and from the Sun. He knew that the apparent size of the moon is the same as the apparent size of the Sun, around 0,5ยบ. 

Using a setup where the moon, sun and earth make up a right triangle, he was able to determine that the distance from the Earth to the Sun was around 19,13 times more distant than the distance from the earth to the moon. He calculated this with [[Fundamental trigonometry]], like the secant. 

Using the fact that the apparent size of both the sun and the moon is 0,5ยบ, and also their relative distance, he could calculate by comparing their "circumferences", the relative distances to the sun and moon from Earth using the Earth's radius. 

Now, what he needed to do was determine the relative size of the Earth! He used the fact that 1 moon fits in the shadow of the Earth caused by the Sun (however, this was off by half of the earths diameter, so all the calculations were in essence wrong, but the method still stays!)

From the system setup, he got many similar triangles, and eventally got to the conclusion that the Earth was 2.8 times larger than the moon, approximately and kinda wrong. 

He was very cool for another reason, which is that he was the first ever person to champion for the heliocentric model, but since Aristotel was the main guy, his claims were denied. Aristotles arguments were that the parallax was not noticed, but that's because stars are too far and they didn't have very good measuring systems. He said that there were no winds? and that nobody flew off hahahaha. 

## Heliocentric model

But, alas, the heliocentric model wouldn't die. Many, many years after Aristarchus, influental scientists worked hard on proving that our solar system was actually heliocentric. 

Thus far, the system looked as such: everything orbited the Earth in circular orbits, but on those circular paths another circular path with the planet orbited, to account for retrograde motion. While this is pretty math, it is extremely impractical for physical purposes. 

Then, in the middle ages, polish scientist Nicholas Copernicus came along and founded the idea of the heliocentric model (again). He is the one who started modern astronomy, albeit he was a bit questionable in empirical practices himself. His theory wasn't based on strict scientific fact, but rather on very simplified calculations of planetary orbits. 

After Copernicus, Galileo Galilei came along, an Italian physicist, who started modern empirical science with facts and experiments. He showed that the heliocentric model is correct using ==telescopes==. Using the telescope, he showed that Venus had phases, which it wouldn't have if it didn't orbit the Sun. There were also other pieces of evidence, but the Church pronounced him a heretic and sentenced him to house arrest. 

But then, Kepler came along and made his famous [[Kepler's laws]]. Johannes Kepler was a German astronomer who was the student of Tycho Brache, who collected enormous amounts of data from planetary observations. After Tycho was either poisoned by Kepler or died naturally by holding his pee for too long, Kepler took his data and managed to develop 3 laws of planetary motion. He didn't know ==why== they worked, only how!
