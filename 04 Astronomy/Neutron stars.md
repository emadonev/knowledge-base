If the stellar core well into [[Stellar old age]] is over the Chandrasekhar limit for [[White dwarf]]s, then it continues to collapse, and forces [[Protons]] and [[Electron]]s to **form [[Neutrons]]** together. These create a ==neutron star==. 

### Neutron degeneracy pressure
---
This pressure is super similar to the *electron degeneracy pressure in white dwarfs*, however since we only have neutrons now, it is much, much higher and waaaay denser of a star.
- f $$P \approx 2(\frac{h}{2\pi})^2\;\frac{\rho^{5/3}}{m_n^{8/3}}$$

By looking at this formula, we can see that the pressures are related to their **densities and by a factor of $m_e/m_p$**. 

Due to the extreme gravitational pull of neutron stars, the change in $g$ over radius is significant, around$$dg/dr = -\frac{2GM}{R^3}$$
which means that there are **significant and strong [[Tidal forces]] at play**. This also means that the **atmosphere is around 1 cm thick**!!

### Rotation of neutron stars
---
As the star becomes smaller, it *needs to rotate faster, due to the conservation of [[Angular momentum]].* It is given by $$J = I\omega$$, where $I$ is the rotational inertia, or how much a body resists rotating - analogous to [[Inertia]] in linear motion. It is calculated via the distribution of mass inside of our object. $\omega$ is the angular velocity, or how much a body rotates per second. 

Now, the moment of inertia is interesting. 
- eg If we wanted to find out the moment of inertia for a **solid sphere**, which is the case for most stars (including neutron ones), we need to use [[Calculus]]. However, a very complex form of **polynomial integrals**, which we are not going to get into, but rather just say that for a solid sphere, the moment of inertia calculated by slicing up a sphere into tiny disks is:$$I = \frac{2}{5}MR^2$$
