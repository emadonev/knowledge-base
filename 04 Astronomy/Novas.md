A nova is a nuclear explosion on a [[White dwarf]]. This star is part of a binary system where the stars are close enough for the companion star to extract material from the white dwarf. In doing so, it creates a dense and shallow atmosphere mostly composed of hydrogen. Once it is put up against great pressure and temperature, it undergoes nuclear fusion which causes a super bright flare, several magnitudes in force, and then it fades over a few weeks or months. The white dwarf is whole during this process, but this can potentially repeat, causing [[Recurrent novas]].

There are 3 types of Novae:
1. **NA types:** these are fast novae, a sudden increase in brightness, followed by a decline within 100 days
2. **NB types:** these are slow novae, decline of 3 magnitudes in 150 days or more

3. **NC types:** super slow novae! These stay at the same brightness for decades before cooling off super slowly. 

## Nova-Likes
These stars are not inherently variable, but really they are nova-likes because that these are the same stars as old novae, but these have not undergone the eruption yet.
