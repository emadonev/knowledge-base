These are actually not stars! These are galaxies whose core is suuper bright compared to the rest of the galaxy. It is believed that the core consists of Supermassive [[Black hole]]s which expel tons of energy via jets.

# Algol variables

These types of variables are eclipsing [[Binary star system]]s, where the 2 components are slightly [[Ellipsoidal stars (ELL)]]. The light curve between eclipses is basically **flat**, a result from the ellipsoidality of the components or the [[Reflection effect]]. 

![[algol_lc.png]]
# Beta Lyrae variables (EB)
---
These are eclipsing [[Variable stars]] which contain [[Ellipsoidal stars (ELL)]], contained in a [[Binary star system]]. The periods of these stars are usually lower than 1 day, and the brightness is constantly changing. 

![[EB_lc.png]]

# BY Dra variables
These types of [[Variable stars]] are red dwarfs which are not perfectly period, rather semiperiodic. Their periods range from hours to 120 days! The brightness varies during this period via large dark and bright spots which appear on it's surface. 

![[BY_Dra_lc.png]]
# Cepheid variables
---
These types of [[Variable stars]] pulsate in a steady, repeating cycle, and they are typically yellow supergiants. Their period is from 1 to 70 days or 1 to 100 days, with an amplitude from 0.1 to 2.0 magnitudes difference. They are very massive stars, and they are candles in the universe for calculating distance since they are as steady as a heartbeat. They are approximatively 6 times the mass of [[The Sun]], and have a radius around 25 times that of the Sun.

![[cepheid_lc.png]]
They exhibit a relationship called the [[Period-luminosity relationship]], where the period is directly tied to the luminosity. There are 2 subtypes of cepheids:
1. Classical Cepheids or **Delta Cepheids**: 4-20 times more massive than the Sun, O-B type stars
![[cepheid_lc2.png]]
![[comparison_cepheid_lc.png|400]]

2. **Type II Cepheids**: less massive and older than delta cepheids ([[Population II type stars]]), 1-50 days period or 1-100 periods, O-B type stars. It is super important to note that these types of cepheid stars follow a **different [[Period-luminosity relationship]]!**


The [[Pulsation principles of stars]] in cepheids is valid, with the ionization of He+ into He++, which causes changes in temperature, radius, pressure and the radial pulsation can be spotted with [[The Doppler effect]]. This is why as well as the change in magnitude over time, we can track the temperature, radius and radial velocity.

# Delta-scuti variables (DSCT)
---
These are [[Variable stars]] which are dwarf [[Cepheid variables]], where the [[Luminosity]] varies from less than 1% to more than 100%! These are super fluctuating variables. They are A-F type stars. The period is from around 0.01 to 0.2 days! Suuuper fast! These are the most common pulsating stars found in the universe, and they are well understood. Lots of these stars are multi-periodic, meaning they pulsate in a number of different ways, resulting in various period times. This makes determining their periods via [[Analyzing light curves]] super challenging. DSCT's which have a greater amplitude of magnitude (larger than 0.2) are called High amplitude Delta Scutis or **HADS**.

# Dwarf novas
---
These dwarf novas have a similar setup to [[Novas]], with a white dwarf and a companion star. The white dwarf accretes the material, but it forms a disk around itself. And here, it is the disk which undergoes a nuclear reaction and ignites, rather than the dwarf. This burst is usually much smaller in magnitude compared to [[Supernova]]s or [[Novas]]. 

### U Geminorum
U Geminorum are a sub-class of dwarf novae, these systems are much closer than regular dwarf novas!
![[dwarf_nova_lc.png]]

### Z camelopardalis stars
Eruptions occur at intervals of 10 to 30 days, where sometimes these stars are at **stillstands or standstills.** These are the periods where the brightness does not change for a VERY long time before returning to the eruptions!
![[dwarf_nova_lc2.png]]
### SU Ursae Majoris stars
Very short orbital periods, typically less than 2 hours! They have 2 different kinds of outbursts: a short one, which lasts a few days, and a *superoutburst* which is long, and has a 10-20 long duration. The smaller the outburst, the more frequent it is. 

![[dwarf_nova_lc3.png]]

### SS Cygni stars
These types of stars increase in magnitude by 2 till 6, and return to their origigi brightness within a few days. They repeat this brightening then fading every few days, or even every few years! 
![[SS_cygni_lc.png]]

### WZ Sagittae stars
These stars have an extremely short period (around 90 minutes!) and they have superoutbursts. After a superoutburst, they cool off on the brightness for a few years or even decades. These outbursts can sometimes be even brighter than supernovae!!
![[WZ_Sagittae_lc.png]]
A note: these stars also exhibit echo outbursts, where the brightness briefly increases and decreases on its slow decline back to the original state. 

# Ellipsoidal stars (ELL)
---
These stars are found in binary systems where the companions are so close they **are not spherical anymore!** Due to the high gravitational attraction, the stars are ellipsoidal and as the amount of surface area we see and therefore brightness we see changes (since they are not spherical) and *voila* we have a variable star! 

![[ELL_lc.png]]

# EXor variables
---
These stars are eruptive [[T Tau variables]] which brighten up over a couple of months and then fade. They are generally repeating eruptions.

![[EXors_lc.png]]

# Flare stars
---
These types of stars are faint red dwarfs, which exhibit sudden changes in brightness across the entire EM spectrum called **flares**. These flares are similar to [[Solar flares]]. 

There are some types of flare stars such as [[UV Cet stars]]. 

# FU Orionis variables
---
These types of variable stars are super young like [[T Tau variables]]! They have a gradual increase in magnitude by 4-6, which is not little. They stay at their max for years before fading out again. The light curve looks like super slow waves. 

# Gamma Cas stars
---
These are rapidly rotating variables. They temporarily brighten or fade, because of the formation of rings around their equator or because of the formation of disks. As the star rapidly rotates, there is mass outflow in their equatorial zones, causing these structures. 

# Gamma-ray burst stars
---
These stars exhibit super luminous explosions which can happen in a few millisecond and last 20-40 seconds. It is the most luminous electromagnetic event ever!! A very strong afterglow is left, most prominently in the gamma ray spectrum. 

# Long period variables (LVP)
---
These stars are red giants or supergiants which have extremely long periods from 30 to 1000 dats. The 2 subclasses of these stars are [[Mira stars]]  and [[Semiregular stars]]. 

# Magnetic variables
---
These stars have super strong magnetic fields. These fields are the cause of their variability, and there are a few ways to go about this:
1. creation of star spots: these spots are cooler and darker, and as the star rotates they cause changes in brightness
2. when the magnetic field interacts with the stellar or [[Solar wind]]. Once these two collide, particles will suddenly start emitting light due to the influence of the magnetic field, changing the output brightness of the star. 

There are more types of magnetic variables.

## DG Herculis stars: intermediate polars
These stars are part of a [[Binary star system]]]] where one is a low-mass star, and the other is a [[White dwarf]]. As an accretion disk around the white dwarf forms, it is disrupted close around the white dwarf due to an extremely strong magnetic field. 
![[DG_herculis_expo.png|200]]
![[DG_herculis_lc.png]]
## AM Her stars: polars
These stars have the same binary star system as the previous type, but here the magnetic field is soo strong that accretion disks cannot form! The stars are tidally locked, spinning at the same speed around each other. The streams of matter go towards the poles of the white dwarf, slamming into it at speeds of 3000 km/s, which causes a large X-ray shock. This, coupled with the two maxima and two minima of brightness of the second star due to its shape, is the reason for its variability. 
![[AM her_expo.png|200]]
![[AM_her_lc.png]]
# Mira stars 
---
These variables are red giants with a period from 80 to 1000 days. They have large amplitude swings, always more than 2.5 magnitude changes, up to 1000 during a cycle! These stars are massive, and when they pulsate, their whole size expands. While pulsating they tend to eject materials into space, and this mass loss might have some serious consequences for their future.

![[mira_lc.png|500]]
![[mira_lc2.png|500]]
Why is the amplitude change so large for mira variables? Mira stars are very old and highly evolved, being the largest, coolest and most luminous of the red giants. As the star becomes fainter, it cools down and since there is less thermal energy, it is less bright (less [[Photons]] are released in the visible part of the spectrum.) A special thing about Mira variables is that when they cool they form $TiO$ molecules which are very good at absorbing all of the light coming from the star, making it appear even dimmer. 

# Novas
---
A nova is a nuclear explosion on a [[White dwarf]]. This star is part of a binary system where the stars are close enough for the companion star to extract material from the white dwarf. In doing so, it creates a dense and shallow atmosphere mostly composed of hydrogen. Once it is put up against great pressure and temperature, it undergoes nuclear fusion which causes a super bright flare, several magnitudes in force, and then it fades over a few weeks or months. The white dwarf is whole during this process, but this can potentially repeat, causing [[Recurrent novas]]. 
Light curve:
![[nova_lc.png|500]]
There are 3 types of Novae:
1. **NA types:** these are fast novae, a sudden increase in brightness, followed by a decline within 100 days
2. **NB types:** these are slow novae, decline of 3 magnitudes in 150 days or more
![[NB_lkc.png|500]]
3. **NC types:** super slow novae! These stay at the same brightness for decades before cooling off super slowly. 

## Nova-Likes
These stars are not inherently variable, but really they are nova-likes because that these are the same stars as old novae, but these have not undergone the eruption yet.
![[nova-like_lc.png|500]]

# R Coronae Borealis
---
These are rare supergiant variable stars which spend most of their time at their maximum brightness, and sometimes, in irregular patterns, drop their brightness by several magnitudes in a short period of time. 

Why do these stars dim randomly? Well, it is because of the carbon-rich dust which envelopes the surface of these stars and blocks their light. As time passes, the dust disperses, leaving the star once again at full brightness, and sometimes it envelopes the star like a cloud, shrouding it in darkness. 

These types of supergiants are thought to be a product of merging to different white dwarf types: one which is carbon-rich and another one which is helium-rich. This chemical composition enables the formation of the dust. Another theory is that this type of star is formed from a planetary nebula, sort of like a phoenix rising from its ashes, the star would be "reborn" into an RCB.

![[RCB_lc.png]]

# Recurrent novas
---
These [[Novas]] are observed to occur at the same star more than once. The amplitude of these eruptions is much smaller! Depending on the mass of the white dwarf, it can take different amounts of time for the nova to occur again. Smaller stars need more time to recover and to explode again. It is thought that recurrent novae are presteps to [[Supernova]]s! As they keep occurring, the mass of the white dwarf increases, and after a while explodes!  

![[reccurrent_nova_lc.png]]


# RS CVn variables
---
These [[Variable stars]] are parts of binary systems, where these are red giants! These stars have large chromospheric activity, which is caused by strong magnetic fields of the rapidly rotating second companion of the binary system. Its as if the binary component spun the variable star faster than it normally would spin, giving it rotational rates up to 7 times larger than regular stars. The aspect which gives the variability are dark spots which rotate rapidly on the surface. 

![[RV CVn_lc.png|400]]

# RV Tauri
---
These stars are yellow supergiants, which have long and slightly irregular periods. They range from 30 to 100 days or 150 days. They have alternating low and shallow minima.  

![[rvtauri_lc.gif]]
The stars are separated into 2 categories:
1. **RVA types**: these stars do not vary in mean magnitude
2. **RVB types:** these do vary in mean magnitude, with periods of 600 to 1500 days!

![[RV_tauri_lc2.png]]
*Another example of a RV Tauri light curve.*

# S Doradus stars
---
These types are also known as Luminous Blue Variables or LBVs. They are very luminous and large which are sometimes unpredictable and have large fluctuations in brightness. They change brightness due to pulsations, eruptions or changes in the star's atmosphere, and also if material is lost from the star. These stars are super short lived, and this variability stage is only a part of its life cycle. 

*Light curve of Eta carinae*
![[eta_carinae_lc.png|400]]

# Semiregular stars
---
These stars are typically giants and supergiants which have a semiregular period. This means that they have a regular period, but sometimes something happens and an irregularity occurs. They last from 20 to 2000 days, with lower magnitude changes, less than 2.5.
![[semiregular_lc.png]]
![[semiregular_lc2.png]]
There are many types of semiregular stars.
1. **SRA types:** these stars have very small amplitude changes and have periods typically from 35-1200 days which happen to be quite regular.
2. **SRB types:** these stars do not really have a defined period (usually in the range of 20 to 2300 days), and exhibit slow and irregular changes to its period. 
3. **SRC types:** these supergiants have small amplitudes (very small, around 1 mag), and have variations in the periods (variation of 30 to thousands of days: quite a large range!)
4. **SRD types:** these giants and supergiants of types F, G or K have relatively small amplitudes ranging from barely any change (0.1) to quite a change (4). Their periods range from 30 to 1100 days. 

# Sx Phoenix variables
---
These stars are quite similar to [[Delta-scuti variables (DSCT)]], and are naturally also [[Variable stars]]. These are mostly found in [[Globular clusters]], with periods as short as 1-2 hours! 

# Symbiotic stars
---
These types of stars are found in a binary system of stars. This system consists of a white dwarf and a cool red giant. The red giant loses mass via stellar winds or [[Roche lobe]] overflow. This creates a disk around white dwarfs. The symbiosis between these stars is that constantly matter flows from one star to the other. The red giant pulsates, while the white dwarf and its disk exhibit [[Dwarf Novas]] and [[Novas]].

![[symbiotic_star_lc.png]]
# T Tau variables
---
These stars are pre-main sequence: super young starlets!

They do not yet have fusion processes, and they vary in brightness because of 3 possible sources of variability (we aren't sure yet)
1. PHOTOSPHERE - star spots (like sunspots), large darker areas, and when a star rotates, different fractions of the surface are shown, light is variable.
2. CHROMOSPHERE
3. Changing opacity in the dust shell surrounding the star

They are typically less than 10 million years old and very small. 60% are younger than 3 million years, while 10% are around 10 million years. These stars are considered variables because they have an [[Protoplanetary disks]], or accretion disks surrounding them, which give rise to chaotic behaviour. 

Due to the fact that Doppler-shifted absorption wings are present, it shows that there might be infall of material into the star, with solar winds altering the brightness. 

Their characteristic is a super strong $H\alpha$ emission line:
![[Halpha emission.png|300]]

There are 2 categories:
1. **Classic T Tauri stars (CTTS):** they have large disks which give rise to strong emission lines
2. **Weak lined T Tauri stars(WTTS):** they have a very opaque and transparent disk or no disk at all! These are super interesting to find because there is no gas or dust to obscure the view of early star formation. 
![[t tauri light curves.png|300]]
# UV Cet stars
---
These are [[Flare stars]] which flare up to several magnitudes in brightness within **a few seconds!!** They are generally red dwarfs, as flare stars are too. 

# UXor variables
---
These stars are pre-main sequence (not yet fully developed stars), they have irregular periods and their nature is not really understood. 

![[UXors_c.png]]

# W Ursae Majoris variables (EW)
---
These are [[Eclipsing variables]] with [[Ellipsoidal stars (ELL)]] an they are nearly touching in the [[Binary star system]]. 

![[EW_lc.png]]
# W Virginis (CW) variables
---
CW [[Variable stars]] can have amplitudes from 0.3 to 1.2 magnitudes in the visible spectrum, and have periods from 0.8 to 35 days. We divide these into 2 sub types.

1. Periods shorter than 8 days: **CWB**
![[CWB_lc.png]]
2. Periods longer than 8 days: **CWA**
![[CW_lc.png]]


# Wolf-Rayet stars
---
These types of stars are fairly old massive stars which lost and are still losing lots of mass because of Stelar winds, similar to a [[Solar wind]]. Most of its light is in the UV part of the spectrum since its surface temperature is very high. We do not really understand how they work, or how their winds work. WR stars have emission lines of highly ionized helium, nitrogen, carbon and oxygen.
