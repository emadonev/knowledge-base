In the process of accretion, tiny pebbles form each the size of a few milimeters or centimeters, each of them colliding into each other, slowly forming larger pebbles, now attracting more mass, etc. Using this process, gas giants could form 1000 times faster than in the core accretion model, ensuring that they can accumulate a giant atmosphere in the timescale it had. In [[The core accretion model]], it would take a few million years to create the cores of gas giants, at which point there are no more gases for their enourmous atmospheres.

The pebbles are really small clumps of gas and dust which are flash heated (the heat source is unknown) into chondrules, a rock type which formed most cores in the solar system.

ALMA, a telescope in Atacama took a picture of a protoplanetary disk, and it found 100 times Earths mass worth of pebbles, perfect for planetary formation.

The model also provides a recipe on how to form habitable planets. Earth could have a steady supply of water coming in from water or ice pebbles, which when incorporated with Earth could form oceans. This is a much more feasible option, and it takes Earth maybe a few million years, rather than 100 million years to form. Having pebbles as "snow" makes it much easier to calculate and analyse how Earth got its water and atmosphere. 

Scientists think that pebble accretion is a fundamental component of building terrestrial planets, however that it is not the dominant force. It is thought that a combination of pebbles and planetesimals formed the solar system. 

While the pebble model is much better than the core accretion model, still many questions are unanswered. Maybe there is a combination of the two?
