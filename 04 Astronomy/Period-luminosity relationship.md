This relationship was discovered by Henrietta Swan Leavitt (1868-1921). She was working at the Harvard College Observatory, one of many women working low wages, assisting Edward Pickering.

It states that the longer the period of [[Variable stars]], the larger their [[Luminosity]] is. This was a monumental discovery, since we can accurately get the period of a variable star.

An interesting result of the callibration process of Cepheid variables is the fact that there are 2 groupings of cepheids with 2 different periods: one of a bit less than 1 day, and another between 1 and 10 days. With this, we divide Cepheids into **type I and type II Cepheids.** 
- n Type I are called classical cepheids, and the Type II are called [[W Virginis (CW) variables]]. Type I were first found in the Magellanic clouds, while type II are found in [[Globular clusters]] in [[the Milky Way]]. *An important note is that Type II cepheids are around 1.5 mags fainter than classical cepheids of the **same period.***
