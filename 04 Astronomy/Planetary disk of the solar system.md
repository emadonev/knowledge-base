All of the planets in the solar system can be found orbiting in the same ecliptic plane and orbiting the sun in the same direction. This is a clue that the planets formed in a planetary disk which formed around our sun, then a protostar. The disk formed when gravity which pulled gas and dust inwards towards the protostar was opposed by the centrifugal force because of the rotation of the gas and its pressure. The gravity at the poles of the disk are opposed only by the pressure, so the disk collapsed at the poles, flattening it into a rotating disk of gas. 

The cloud which formed our disk was kept together by thermal energy countering the force of gravity. As soon as the cloud starts loosing heat, then gravity starts kicking ass and beating thermal energy and collapsing the cloud. 

Why does the disk flatten out? Because of particle movement. Particles move "randomly" across the spherical cloud, but they actually don't, since gravity governs where they move. So little by little the particles get going into one direction and nudge other particles to do the same, due to [[Angular momentum]] conservation.

What is the time between collisions between particles?
$$t = \frac{\frac{1}{p * A}}{v}$$, where p is density, A is area and v is speed.


Gravitational energy converted to thermal kinetic energy, thus heating up the disk. The nebula gets denser the closer we get towards the protostar because that is where most of the heat is. Because of the large heat, the gas doesn't fully become part of the protostar, and the contraction of the nebula is stopped. The contraction would continue at the further reaches of the disk and would be opposed by the disk's rotation.

There are 2 main models talking about the mass distribution in the early solar system:
1. **Minimum solar nebula model**
	- mass of the nebula is the same as the present total mass of the planets with enough gases to retain the same composition as the Sun today
2. **Massive solar nebula model**
	- model that the nebula and the protosun had the same mass as today's sun. 

Due to these models, it is shown that a lot of material is lost and ejected during the process of [[Star formation]]. And because of the processes mentioned below, it is thought that the actual amount of mass in the begining is somewhere between the 2 extreme models.

We return to [[The angular momentum problem in the solar system]]. It means that the Sun transffered most of its angular momentum into the protoplanetary disk.
Because of this, the whole planetary disk had to have **viscous drag**. The drag was created by **turbulence due to the interactions of particles.** This still doesn't explain how the disk rotated as one! However, we have a solution. Because of the viscous drag, the momentum is transfered further out towards the farther reaches of the nebula. The farther material is speeded up because of the angular momentum, and it continues carrying it further, and the inner part is slowing down and falling towards the sun. This process also explains the *mass lost* in the nebula. Later, the whole system looses more mass when the protostar showers the system with stellar winds which blow gas away.

Because of the viscous drag the disk grew even hotter, as friction transforemed into thermal kinetic energy. As the nebula became more transparent due to the mass lost and the heat started to dissipate after a while, the whole system **started to cool and condense.** Condensing is basically when an element goes from a higher state of energy into a lower state of energy, usually from a gas into a liquid or from a liquid into a solid. In the extreme situation of a protoplanetary disk, the **gas immediately transformed into solids due to a process called *desublimation*.** In the disk, ions and free floating atoms coalesced together into small compouds, which slowly started to attracted other atoms thus forming **grains.** This is the beginning of the [[Composition of early solar system]].
