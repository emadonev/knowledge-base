There are many models trying to depict the migration of the planets in the solar system!
A few are: [[The Nice model]], [[The grand track]] and the [[Rebounding model]]. The main evidence of the Rebounding model are the inclinations and eccentricities of the gas giants. 

Maybe there were more 8 planets, and models show that maybe 1-2 giant planets were flung away from the solar system, into the plunges of the space outside of our protective solar system. There might have also been 2 more rocky planets in the inner solar system, where one collided with Earth to form the moon, and one collided with Mercury, stripping it of most of its outer regions and leaving it with a very large iron core.
