A big problem for observing in astronomy ([[Limitations to observations in astronomy]]) is the fact that the **vernal equinox is slipping backwards at 50" per year**, which is called *precession of the equinoxes*, discovered by Hipparchus in ancient greece since he critisized a poem which inaccurately described the positions of certain constellations. The period, called Ptolemaic period is 26000 years before the equinox makes a full circle around. Due to precession, the declinations and latitudes of stars change over the years ([[coordinate systems in astro]]). 

The cause of precession is known, thanks to [[The universal law of gravitation]], [[The Sun]], [[Motion of the moon]] and [[Earth]]. The gravitational pulls between the Earth, Moon and Sun cause the Earth to rotate like a spinning top (or well the polar axis rotates), with a period of 26000 years.
