Planetary disks come in all shapes and sizes, newly photographed by SPHERE and GPI in the Atacama desert and in the Chilean mountains.

Here are some examples:

An interesting aspect are the cocentric circles and the spiral arms.

### Spiral arms
There are 2 ideas about how these spirals form.

1. gas and dust, while spinning around the protostar (or star), begin to pile up, forming the spirals. However, something has to cause the beginning of the pile up. An idea is that gravitational instability can cause fluctiations in gas and dust quantities, piling them up and forming spirals. 
2. Giant planets can cause these arms! The giant would be located at the tip of the spiral and drag the gas across the disk, as it orbits the newborn star. Evidence was found that a massive body could trigger the formation of spiral arms (in this case a dwarf nearby star).
It is thought that the spirals form around more massive stars, since spirals were found around sun-like stars. 

### Cocentric circles and gaps
The most prevailent theory is that as planets form, they carve out their path as they orbit the protoplanetary disk, sweeping it clean of materials. So when we look at the disk, we can see the traces of planetary pathways. However, magnetic fields and chemical composition can also leave blank holes in the disk.
