Most [[Stars]] are **spherical** in nature, and they pulsate in different ways:

### Radial pulsation
-----
This way of pulsation is when the whole star radially contracts and expands, all layers going in, out, in, out. The principle behind this pulsation is in the [[Eddington valve]]. 
> *"The inward pull of gravity is balanced by the outward pressure of the hot gas in the star. If the star begins to contract, its internal pressure and temperature increase, and reverse the contraction. If the star begins to expand, its internal pressure and temperature decrease, and gravity restores the initial balance. Furthermore, if a star expands or contracts, the energy of motion is dissipated by friction. Eventually, the star returns to rest."* - [ A book on variable stars](https://cfas.org/data/uploads/astronomy-ebooks/variable-stars.pdf)

So, stars pulsate via the eddington valve of ionized helium, and these stars are found in the instability strips of the HR diagram. Here is the ionization energy necessary for each layer of an RR Lyrae star.

Every star has *infinite pulsation modes.* 
- The simplest is called the *fundamental overtone:* this is when all parts of the star expand and contract.
- The following one is called the *first overtone:* here a ==nodal sphere== is present, where the layers beneath this sphere *contract* during pulsation the layers of the star after the nodal sphere *expand*. The nodal sphere itself ==doesn't expand or contract==. 
- The *second overtone* has 2 nodal spheres, the third has 3 nodal spheres, etc.

[[Variable stars]] such as [[RR Lyrae]], [[Cepheid variables]] and [[Mira stars]] are very commonly radial pulsators with many overtones. Radial pulsation gives stars a significant change in luminosity, colour and radial velocity.

- pr *What is the period of a pulsation mode?*  This is the time period necessary for one cycle of pulsation to be complete.

> *"These stars, all confined to a narrow region of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, pulsate for the same reason: pulsations are driven by radiation being partially blocked from escaping the star, and the resulting increase in pressure and temperature makes them expand.  When gravity makes them contract again, the cycle repeats.  Due to the physical properties of stars and stellar interiors, only stars with very specific physical properties can do this, and those that can lie on a narrow diagonal strip of the H-R diagram running from hot, blue, and faint stars at lower left, to cooler, redder, and brighter stars at upper right.  Where this strip intersects a common population of stars within the H-R diagram is where you'll usually find pulsators."* - [AAVSO website](https://www.aavso.org/vsots_rrlyr)



# Pulsation models
------
We can model stars using one of the many models for stars, and the most complex and accurate one is the *non-linear non-adiabatic theory*, which accounts for the full, time-dependent hydrodynamical model of the star. 

> *"An ongoing problem in stellar pulsation is: what determines what mode(s) a star will pulsate in, and with what amplitude?"* -[ A book on variable stars](https://cfas.org/data/uploads/astronomy-ebooks/variable-stars.pdf) 

### Non-linear effects
------
What are some of the effects that the pulsation modes have on stars? Sometimes the layers can bunch up and cause ==shock waves==, or due to the change of gas into dust and that dust absorbing radial motion and then taking gas with it causing ==mass loss==. 


## Non-radial pulsation
-----
This type of pulsation is when stars change their shape and not their volume. 


# Quantifying pulsation
---
Let's think about pulsating stars as an expanding sphere, where gravity ([[The universal law of gravitation]]) constantly pushes the star in, then out, in, then out - **like a pendulum.** The period of a pendulum is:
$$T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}$$
In the case of a star, $L = R$, the radius, and $g = \frac{GM}{R^2}$, so factoring that in we get:
- f $$T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{R^3}{GM}}$$

But, we can see that the R and the M look awfully a lot like density (to the negative first power.) So, we can rewrite this formula for an **approximative** version:
- f $$T = (G\rho)^{-1/2}$$
