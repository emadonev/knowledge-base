These are rare supergiant variable stars which spend most of their time at their maximum brightness, and sometimes, in irregular patterns, drop their brightness by several magnitudes in a short period of time. 

Why do these stars dim randomly? Well, it is because of the carbon-rich dust which envelopes the surface of these stars and blocks their light. As time passes, the dust disperses, leaving the star once again at full brightness, and sometimes it envelopes the star like a cloud, shrouding it in darkness. 

These types of supergiants are thought to be a product of merging to different white dwarf types: one which is carbon-rich and another one which is helium-rich. This chemical composition enables the formation of the dust. Another theory is that this type of star is formed from a planetary nebula, sort of like a phoenix rising from its ashes, the star would be "reborn" into an RCB.
