These pulsating [[Variable stars]] are very old white giants with a low metallicity. They are common in globular clusters since they are old and these clusters are old, currently burning helium instead of hydrogen. They have very short pulsation periods, from 0.05 to 1.2 days, and from 0.3 to 2 magnitudes in change. They are typically A type stars with lower mass than [[Cepheid variables]].All RR Lyrae stars have the same intrinsic brightness, so they are used for [[Calculating distances in astronomy]]. These stars exhibit the [[Period-luminosity relationship]]. They are the most common variables we know of! Related to these variable stars is the [[Blazhko effect]], whose explanation we still do not know of!

RR Lyrae are further divided into 3 subclasses:
1. **RRAB type:** these have asymmetrical light curves, with periods from 0.3 to 1.2 days (very short period), and relatively low magnitude changes (from 0.5 to 2 magnitudes). These stars pulsate in the fundamental mode. The amplitude is strongly correlated to the period of the RR Lyrae star #todo([[VARIABLE STAR PROJECT]] - maybe you could show this?) Shorter periods usually result in higher amplitudes.

2. **RRC type:** these have nearly symmetrical light curves with periods from 0.2 to 0.5 days (even shorter!), and a small magnitude change in the visible spectrum. These stars pulsate in the first overtone.

3. **RRD types**: these stars pulsate in 2 different ways: in the radial way, and in the first overtone way. The first overtone is when the star un-uniformly expands and contracts, kind of like the non-radial way of pulsation. The longer period (radial pulsation) is typically 0.74 days, while the shorter, non-radial pulsation is typically 0.5 days.

# Pulsation modes of RR Lyrae
RR Lyrae are specific in their nature, but they follow many [[Pulsation principles of stars]]. A very interesting fact is that ==rr lyrae can change pulsation modes during their lifetime!==
