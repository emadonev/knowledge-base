These [[Variable stars]] are parts of binary systems, where these are red giants! These stars have large chromospheric activity, which is caused by strong magnetic fields of the rapidly rotating second companion of the binary system. Its as if the binary component spun the variable star faster than it normally would spin, giving it rotational rates up to 7 times larger than regular stars. The aspect which gives the variability are dark spots which rotate rapidly on the surface.
