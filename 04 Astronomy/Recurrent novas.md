These [[Novas]] are observed to occur at the same star more than once. The amplitude of these eruptions is much smaller! Depending on the mass of the white dwarf, it can take different amounts of time for the nova to occur again. Smaller stars need more time to recover and to explode again. It is thought that recurrent novae are presteps to [[Supernova]]s! As they keep occurring, the mass of the white dwarf increases, and after a while explodes!
