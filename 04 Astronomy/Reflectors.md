These types of [[Telescopes]], [[Optical telescopes]] use the principle of **reflection** in order to bounce light around for us to be able to see it. They can support large diameters of objectives, shorter lengths of the tubus, we don't have chromatic abberation or some other types of abberrations, and they are easier to use!

The first reflector made was **Newton's telescope**, but many other designs followed, including ones ==with both mirrors and lenses==.

And, in order to build even bigger telescopes, we can put mirrors together into an array so that we have a huge surface area of collection, without mirror sagging.
