The earliest and simplest [[Telescopes]] were **refractors**, a type of [[Optical telescopes]] whose main property is the ==use of lenses for bending [[Light]] and focusing it.== They are pretty easy to build and cheap, however have many many drawbacks.

- !! Since light is refracted, the tube has to be **very long** for larger lenses, which is hard to build and manouver
- !! Due to the refraction of light, **different wavelengths of light refract differently**, meaning that the image is discolored -> ==chromatic abberration==, and we need an *achromat* in order to fix this

A better telescope without these problems are [[Reflectors]], which **reflect instead of bend light**.
