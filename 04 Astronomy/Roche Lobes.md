What is this lobe? It is a fundamental concept in [[Binary star system]]s, where it is the maximum diameter of each component star before it starts transffering material to its component. There are 3 types of binary systems based on their Roche Lobes.

1. *Detached binaries*: both components are within the Roche Lobes
2. *Semi-detached binaries*: one star fills the Roche Lobe and is distorted, it starts losing mass to the other star.
3. *Contact binaries*: These are binaries which have both filled their lobes and are in contact. They sometimes form an envelope and the material is constantly transferred.
