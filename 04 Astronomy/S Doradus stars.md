These types are also known as Luminous Blue Variables or LBVs. They are very luminous and large which are sometimes unpredictable and have large fluctuations in brightness. They change brightness due to pulsations, eruptions or changes in the star's atmosphere, and also if material is lost from the star. These stars are super short lived, and this variability stage is only a part of its life cycle.
