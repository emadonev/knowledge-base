These stars are typically giants and supergiants which have a semiregular period. This means that they have a regular period, but sometimes something happens and an irregularity occurs. They last from 20 to 2000 days, with lower magnitude changes, less than 2.5.

There are many types of semiregular stars.
1. **SRA types:** these stars have very small amplitude changes and have periods typically from 35-1200 days which happen to be quite regular.
2. **SRB types:** these stars do not really have a defined period (usually in the range of 20 to 2300 days), and exhibit slow and irregular changes to its period. 
3. **SRC types:** these supergiants have small amplitudes (very small, around 1 mag), and have variations in the periods (variation of 30 to thousands of days: quite a large range!)
4. **SRD types:** these giants and supergiants of types F, G or K have relatively small amplitudes ranging from barely any change (0.1) to quite a change (4). Their periods range from 30 to 1100 days.
