The first ever satelite in space was **Sputnik**, launched by the USSR in 1957, as a way to communicate from their new ICBM R7 rockets. The USA got worried, but then USSR launched **Sputnik II** also in 1957, with a **dog, Laika**. The USA's first satelite was **Explorer**, and it managed to get into orbit in 1958. Explorer carried cosmic ray instruments which proved Van Allen radiation belts in space. After all of this, the USA formed NASA in 1958. 

The USSR kept beating records before the USA could even start. They had **Luna 2**, first satelite which hit the [[Moon]] in 1959. The first person in space was Yuri Gagarin 12.4.1961.  Soon after another cosmonaut was launched into space, and the **first woman in space, Valentina Tereshkova**, had her first spacewalk aboard the *Vostok 6* mission. The Luna 9 mission was the first to land on the Moon safely, and Luna 10 became the first satellite of the Moon, in 1966. 

During the 1960s, NASA had Project Gemini which served as a tester for spacetravel, and then later launched the **Apollo program**, and with the Apollo 11 mission we landed on the moon in 1969. 

The first flyby was by the **Venera 1** spacecraft, which passed by [[Venus]]. 

USA then launched the Mariner spacecraft:
- **Mariner 1** - failed
- **Mariner 2** - first flyby to collect data of Venus
- **Mariner 3** - failed
- **Mariner 4** - flyby of Mars, 1965
- **Mariner 5** - flyby of Venus
- **Mariner 6 and 7** - dual flyby of Mars
- **Mariner 8** - failed
- **Mariner 9** - first Mars orbiter
- **Mariner 10** - first satellite of [[Mercury]], 1974

- **Pioneer 6** was the first satellite to orbit [[The Sun]], 1965
- **Pioneer 10** was the first flyby of [[Jupiter]], 1973
- **Pioneer 11**was the first flyby of [[Saturn]], 1979
- first flyby of [[Uranus]] was **Voyager 2** in 1986
- in 2015, Daw orbited the protoplanet Ceres, and New Horizons orbited Pluton
- Viking 1 and 2 mission for Mars and also Mars 3
- Voyager 1 was the first spacecraft to leave the solar system in 2012
- the Venera missions landed on Venus and recorded data
	- Venera 4 was the first probe to enter the atmosphere
	- Venera 7 was the first to reach the surface safely
	- After Venera 9 the planet was sufficiently imaged and lots of data was collected
- MESSENGER mission and Mariner 10 are the only missions to Mercury thus far
- several [[Asteroids]] were visited by **Galilleo**
- Galileo and Juno are the only spacecraft which have entered Jupiter's orbit
- Cassini-Huygens mission to Saturn
- JWST! HST! 
- Kepler telescope, Gaia, ...

The first space station was the Soviet **Salyut 1** station launched in 1971. The next space station was by NASA also in the 1970s, called **Skylab**.
