The main component of [[Spectroscopy]] are spectra!

How was spectra or spectral lines discovered? Well, William Hyde Wollaston and Josef von Fraunhofer were looking at [[The Sun]] and discovered that it had dark lines in its spectra called **Fraunhofer spectrum**. They didn't know why they occurred, but there was another scientist on the path to discovery. Kirchoff noticed that gasses could absorb or emit light at certain wavelengths, meaning that certain gases had different perfect wavelengths of emission or absorption. But, why?

All forms of [[Light]] are collectively called ==Electromagnetic radiation==. The entire range of different light wavelengths is called a ==Spectrum== or ==Spectra== for plural. 
- eg **Spectrum** is a graphical representation of the amount of each color of light present in the object's radiation. The horizontal (x) axis is the color (or other proportionally related properties like wavelength, or energy) an the vertical (y) axis denotes the amount of light (or in other words brightness, intensity,  or flux([[Photometric quantities]]))

# Stellar spectra

What if we wanted the spectrum of a star?

Let's say that the gas on the surface of a star has 0 heat: all of the atom's [[Electron]]s would be in their ==ground state==. This means that they have the least amount of energy possible. 
Let's start increasing the temperature. As it increases, the energy of the electrons increases as well (since temperature is the average kinetic energy of atoms :) meaning that ==electrons go into higher excited states==, until obviously they reach a certain energy level where they escape the atom, rendering the atom ==ionized==. 

We can visualize the spectra of stars via 2 different types:
![[visualization of spectra.png]]
- we can see the picture of a spectrum as seen in [[Spectroscopy]]
- However, we can represent it as a graph too

This ==ionization== process is extremely important for spectra of stars. 

# Spectral types - different types of spectra.
---
There are 3 types of spectra: ==continuous, emission and absorption== spectra! And based on the type of material and the perspective we can find each of these types of spectra.

![[spectral types.png]]
## Continuous spectra
---
- this type of spectra is usually the starting point, since [[Blackbody radiation]] is a continuous spectrum which can pass through various mediums
- however, stars and other objects aren't ==exactly continuous==, they have small absorption lines which tell us what the sun is made of!

## Absorption and emission spectrum
---
- these spectra show us which elements are present, either by emission or absorption of energy or well, radiation
- we can also notice they are "complete" or symmetrical
- aborption occurs when energy in the form of [[Photons]] comes in as specific packages of energy which can move [[Electron]]s into specific energy levels in the atom. Only specific wavelengths with a specific energy value can move the electrons, causing aborption

- ![[absorption.gif]]
- ![[absorption_pic.gif]]
- a very similar thing happens with emission, only here energy is released.

- ![[emission.gif]]

But actually, both absorption and emission happen at the same time, but from different perspectives we see different things. 

- the atom absorbs the energy, moving into a higher state but then it emits that energy back out again because atoms want to be in the lowest energy state at all times.
	- we don't see the emission from the same perspective as the absorption because the light is emitted in a different directions
## Transmission spectra
---
- the spectra of planetary atmospheres!

## Reflectance spectra
---
- the spectra of reflected light from objects, it can tell us a lot of information:
	- figuring out the composition of planets, asteroids and comets
	- roughness, shape, orientation

### Hydrogen spectrum
---
Hydrogen produces special spectral lines called the ==Balmer series== in the range from 363.46nm until 656.3 nm. The most prominent line is the ==635.3 nm red line, $H\alpha$ line.== $\ce{->}$ this $H\alpha$ line can be found most commonly in clouds of gas where the [[Electron]]s have been excited due to UV radiation. However, the Balmer series isn't the only hydrogen series:

### Spectral classification of stars
---
We divide stars into their [[Spectral types of stars]]. 

# How are spectral lines made?
---
- so as [[Atoms]] are moving around in the atmospheric layers of some star, [[Photons]] pass through the layers, bumping into atoms the atoms, then absorb the photons, gaining energy. These are called ==absorption lines.== 
	- However, there is a contradiction. If the atom is in an excited state, at a certain point it must unexcite itself by releasing energy. But that would mean that there is no net-absorption! 
- The solution is a second mechanism: ==collisional de-excitation==, which says that atoms can bump into other atoms where the excited energy is converted into kinetic energy, and since the average kinetic energy of a system is temperature, the star's atmospheric layers heat up!

![[electron_states.png]]
- we can see that electrons have different and specific energy levels

# ==Why is spectra useful?==
---
We can use spectra to determine ==density== of stars!

> "We can use spectroscopy to measure the rotation rate of a galaxy, the mass of a planet that causes its star to wobble, the speed of hot gas being ejected from a black hole, the mass of a black hole or the amount of dark matter influencing a starâ€™s motion, and the expansion rate of the universe." - [Webb telescope](https://webbtelescope.org/contents/articles/spectroscopy-101--beyond-temperature-and-composition)
