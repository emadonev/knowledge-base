We divide stars into special categories called ==spectral classes==. This system was developed at Harvard University by human computers (women) who manually classified everything (Annie Jump Cannon). Different stars have different temperature and spectral characteristics. 

# O type stars
---
- typical temperature ranging from 30000K-60000K
- characterized by their $He \; II$ spectra, or ionized helium spectral line only present at very high temperatures

# B type stars
---
- typical temperature ranging from 10000K-30000K
- stronger Balmer lines as well as $He \; I$ spectral lines

# A type stars
---
- typical temperature ranging from 7500K-10000K
- strongest are the Balmer lines + singly ionized elements like magnesium and calcium

# F type stars
---
- typical temperature ranging from 6000K-7500K
- Balmer lines are weaker + prominent $Ca \; II$ lines

# G type stars
---
- [[The Sun]] is a G type star!
- typical temperature ranging from 5000K-6000K
- the $H$ and $K$ lines of ionized calcium are strongest

# K type stars
---
- typical temperature range from 3500K-5000K
- prominent spectral lines from iron and sodium

# M type stars
---
- temperature is anything below 3500K (but still warm enough for a star)
- at these low temperatures, molecules exist and the spectra contains molecular lines
