==Spectroscopy== is a way for astronomers to discover what objects are made of, how hot they are, how they move via only their [[Light]], since matter and light interact in specific ways.

What does spectroscopy analyze? [[Spectra]]! These are the "light indexes" of objects. 

Here are a few examples of some spectra of elements:

Here, there are 4 different absorption spectra for 4 elements: each with its own unique chemical footprint. 

So, basically, light interacts in different ways with different elements which we can see in their spectra *as shown in the image above.*
