Stars form in large [[Molecular clouds]] in galaxies. As there are density changes and fluctuations in the molecular clouds, they group together and start coalescing into a protostar. The dust around the protostar starts to heat up from the energy released by the protostar, warming the gas up significantly and releasing lots of infrared light. As the protostar's energy seeps into the nebula, it ionizes the hydrogen gas making it glow a distinct red and lighting up the sky with beautiful nebulae. 

Sir James Jeans showed that a cloud or a part of it would start to contract in on itself because of the force of gravity, which is how stars form. Because of the nature of [[The universal law of gravitation]], every body is attracted to one another, including the atoms moleculs and paticles. However, the clouds are in a **balanced state, there is no incling towards gravitational collapse**. Jeans said if the force of gravity was greater than the force of pressure, the gravitational coalescing would occur. **The Jeans mass** is the critical mass where gravitational attraction overcomes the force of pressure coming from the motion of individual particles. If a cloud passes this mass it satisfies the *Jeans criterion* and it collapses, forming a star. 
- this model does not take into account rotation, magnetic fields or the influence of other objects such as a supernova explosion.
- good starting point!

As the gravitational attraction ensues, the cloud *fragments, causing cloud fragmentation.* Each of these fragments can later satisfy their own Jeans criterion and form stars, or **star clusters.** 

As the cloud collapses in on itself, the kinetic energy is transformed to thermal kinetic energy and the temperature increases. After a couple of thousand years, the mass reaches temperature of 2000-3000K. At thi stage, the fragment is a **protostar.** As the star forms, it has 2 jets of *stellar wind* which race in 2 directions called *bipolar outflow.* The image below depicts this process.

These outflows last for a short amount of time, and they eject lots of mass and energy. The protostar keeps revolving and contracting and growing hotter and hotter. Eventually it reaches the critical point and begins nuclear fusion at the core. The energy exerted by the fusion creates a very large pressure force which counters gravity, finally rendering the star stable. **And so a star is born!**

When a star collapses, the gravitational [[Potential energy]]  is stored during the collapsation of the [[Molecular clouds]], giving the star ==initial energy to use== before it starts with [[Nuclear fusion]]. This is the first of the [[Stellar energy sources]].
