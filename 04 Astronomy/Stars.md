Stars are giant spherical objects which reside in space and emit light via [[Nuclear fusion]].  

# Age of stars

How old are stars? What's the typical age based on their mass and size?

As discussed in [[Stellar energy sources]], it was theorized that some chemical process could power a star, but it turned out that that wasn't the case, but rather the gravitational contraction plus nuclear fusion powered the first stars. 

Using the [[Virial theorem]] and testing the assumption of gravitational contraction, we know that half of the total energy from the gravitational collapse **could be used for luminosity**, and so:$$L = \frac{1}{2}\;dU/dt$$
Unfortunately, this gives [[The Sun]] around 30 million years of a lifetime (also called *Kelvin-Helmholtz* lifetime), which is obviously too little. Now, using nuclear fusion:$$t = \epsilon\;f\frac{Mc^2}{L}$$, where $\epsilon$ is the efficiency, $f$ is the fraction of mass used for fusion, $M$ is the total mass. This gives a very accurate timeline of around 10 billion years!

### Age of clusters
Now, when we think of [[Star clusters]] and the **HR diagram**, we would like to estimate the *turnoff point* for stars, or the age of the cluster. From our knowledge of [[Binary star system]]s, we can conclude that the age of a cluster is:
> $$t_{cluster} = 10 \;Gyr(\frac{L_s}{L_{star}})^{2/3}$$


# Color of stars
---
Stars have different colors based on their temperature, where hotter stars are more blue and cooler stars are more red. The connection between temperature and wavelength emitted is described by [[Blackbody radiation]]. For more, go to [[The color index]]. 

# Stellar rotation
---
While we might imagine a star to rotate as a whole rigid body, this actually isn't the case for stars as they are mainly composed of *plasma* ! So, other than the standard $$v_{rot} = \frac{2\pi R}{T}$$, we need to account for **differential rotation** using [[The Doppler effect]]!
As different parts move away from us at different rates, we get a **differential doppler shift** or the ***rotational broadening*** of lines:$$\frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda_0} = \frac{v_{rot}\sin i}{c}$$, which gives the **half width.**
