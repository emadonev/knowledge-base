A big part of observing in astronomy with [[Telescopes]] is the problem of the aberration of [[Light]]. This means that due to the motions of the [[Earth]] and the position of the observer, light is going to fall differently into the objective of the telescope:

The aberration is actually the shift in the angle caused by the difference in the motion of light and the earth. 
Looking at the **angle of aberration or $\theta$**, we can see that the change between the actual and observed angle is $\Delta \theta$. Based on the sine rule:$$\frac{sin \; \theta_1}{AE_1} = \frac{sin \; \Delta \theta}{EE_1}$$, where:$AE_1 =ct$, an $EE_1 = vt$, then:$$\frac{sin \; \theta_1}{c} = \frac{sin \; \Delta \theta}{v}$$
Hence:$$sin \; \Delta \theta = \frac{v}{c}sin \; \theta_1$$ and due to the small angle approximation of angles and the fact that theta should be in arc seconds, we get that:
- !! $$\Delta \theta = 206265\frac{v}{c}sin \; \theta = k \; sin \; \theta$$
Where k is equal to 20.496".
