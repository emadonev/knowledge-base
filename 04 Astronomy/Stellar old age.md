As stars age, certain [[Nuclear fusion]] processes change, which change the way a star works and ultimately affects its **evolution progress** - the starting mass of a star determines its fate!

#### The main sequence

> Stars under 5 stellar masses

These [[Stars]] steadily fuse hydrogen into helium for a long time before running out of H to fuse in the core. At this point, the central temperature is not high enough for further fusion, and the star begins to **contract.**

This contraction actually converts gravitational [[Potential energy]] to thermal energy, raising temperatures enough for further fusion of hydrogen in **a shell outside of the core.** This is also called the *hydrogen burning shell.* 

During this process, the energy transfer becomes faster, which in turn expands the outer layers of the star, making it cooler - the radius increased, temperature slightly decreased -> [[Luminosity]] slightly increased, making its way to the subgiant branch of the HR diagram.

- n The mechanism by which the star stays stable (surface temperature is not too low) is that the rate of photon diffusion is proportional to $dT/dr$. The greater the temperature difference, the stronger the energy flow. So, *if the temperature drops too much, the photon diffusion is much stronger, keeping everything in balance.*

The luminosity keeps increasing, and our star makes its way to the red giant track.

Now, since $-dT/dr$ becomes very large the pressure rate, $-dP/dr$ also becomes large. Energy transfer becomes **convective, and not radiative.** This means that packets of hot gas travel upwards where they cool, and then fall back down towards the core. 

Speaking of the core, it heats up a lot and now helium can fuse into carbon, however since now the core is dense, it is not an ideal gas ([[The ideal gas law]]) but rather a [[Degenerative gas]], so the pressure doesn't depend on temperature and there is a **sudden flash of energy - the helium flash**. Afterwards, energy production stabilizes, the core becomes ideal again, and subsequent layers of hydrogen keep on fusing. 

Due to the star becoming large, outer layers are not really kept on to the core, and the star starts shedding mass. Eventually, the core will fuse carbon into oxygen, and further fusion is unavailable. Now, the star expands again, and loses mass again. 

Finally, all the outer layers get blown away, and we are left with a white core - a [[White dwarf]]. 

#### High mass stars

As for high mass stars, they have a shorter lifetime since they go through the material much quicker. This also means that they fuse higher elements, and the more mass a star has, **the stabler fusion is, before the core can become degenerate.** As more and more elements begin fusing, the star just becomes a large sphere filled with shells of different elements fusing.

All the while, [[Luminosity]] increases, the radius expands, and our star becomes bigger and bigger, all the way to the **supergiant branch!** It expands to accommodate for the large temperature difference between the core and surface.
