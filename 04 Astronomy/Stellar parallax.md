We can measure distances to stars using the stellar parallax, or using the earths path around the Sun to measure the position of the star and how it changed as we changed our position. The angle which changed is called the **parallax angle**, and the distance is calculated using simple trigonometry:
$$d = \frac{1 AU}{tan(p)} = \frac{1}{p}AU$$
However, the above calculation works only if *p is defined in radians.* If we were to convert this to degrees, we need a whole new unit called the **parsec**, or the distance where $p=1^"$. 
$$d = \frac{1}{p^"}pc$$
One parsec is 3.26 **light years.** A light year is the distance light travels in a year, which is a very large distance.
