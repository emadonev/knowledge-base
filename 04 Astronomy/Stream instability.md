This models states that gas which was around the sun was forced to gather into clumps, so that the gas wouldn't fall into the star and disappear from the nebula. 
As the dust clumps grew bigger and bigger, gravity trumped the stability of the clump and they collapsed in on themselves. This way they form compact large objects, and with the collision of these objects planetesimals can form more quickly. However, this model is not fast enough for the formation of gas giants. For their formation we need the [[Pebble accretion]] model.
