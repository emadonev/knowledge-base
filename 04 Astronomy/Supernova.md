When [[Stars]] are dying, we have seen from [[Stellar old age]] that low mass stars die a relatively quiet death, while **high mass stars** undergo super interesting and violent deaths.

When a high mass star finishes fusion, it stops at 56 Fe, which has the **highest binding energy** of all atoms, making it extremely stable, and not able to fuse with anything else. Energy production slows down, and well, stops. The star might be able to support itself with *electron degeneracy pressure* as in [[White dwarf]]s, however, if the mass of the core is higher than the Chandrasekhar limit, it **collapses!** 

##### How much energy is available?
---
Energy in the form of **gravitational [[Potential energy]]** is released. A runaway process is triggered, as iron and nickel absorb energy, and tons of neutrons and neutrinos are formed - both of which trigger **an enormous explosion of matter outwards.** $$e^- + p \ce{->} n + \nu$$
- n This is also called a **Type II supernova**, which forms directly from high mass stars. However, via a close [[Binary star system]], a white dwarf and red giant could form different structures, like [[Novas]], [[Dwarf Novas]] and also supernovas, but **Type I**. 


Due to the extremely high energies of the explosions, *lots of elements which are higher than iron (all the way to uranium) form during them, and this material enriches the interstellar medium, and makes its way to planets like [[Earth]].*

#### Supernova remnants
---
What remains after a supernova?
A giant amount of material blown away from the star and lit up by excited atoms via heat. This material used to be from the star, and now spreads cool metals across the universe. Cool supernova remnants are **Cas A, Veil Nebula, SN 1987A**. The radiation supernova remnants give off is called [[Synchrotron radiation]]


A fun fact is that supernovas are actually classified as [[Variable stars]], since their change in magnitude is very significant.
