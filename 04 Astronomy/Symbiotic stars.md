These types of stars are found in a binary system of stars. This system consists of a white dwarf and a cool red giant. The red giant loses mass via stellar winds or [[Roche lobe]] overflow. This creates a disk around white dwarfs. The symbiosis between these stars is that constantly matter flows from one star to the other. The red giant pulsates, while the white dwarf and its disk exhibit [[Dwarf Novas]] and [[Novas]].
