These stars are pre-main sequence: super young starlets!

They do not yet have fusion processes, and they vary in brightness due to many factors like changes in their accretion rate, rotation, star spots, etc. They are typically less than 10 million years old and very small. 60% are younger than 3 million years, while 10% are around 10 million years. These stars are considered variables because they have an [[Protoplanetary disks]], or accretion disks surrounding them, which give rise to chaotic behaviour. 

There are 2 categories:
1. **Classic T Tauri stars (CTTS):** they have large disks which give rise to strong emission lines
2. **Weak lined T Tauri stars(WTTS):** they have a very opaque and transparent disk or no disk at all! These are super interesting to find because there is no gas or dust to obscure the view of early star formation.
