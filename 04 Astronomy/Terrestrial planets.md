# Atmospheres
---
So, if you look at [[The solar system]] and looked at the first four planets, you would see that [[Mercury]] has no atmosphere, [[Venus]] and [[Earth]] have an atmosphere and [[Mars]] barely has one, but it is still there. Which factors are important for atmosphere retention?
- gravity
	- depends on the **mass and radius of the planet**
- random thermal motions - collisions between gas molecules
	- depends on the **temperature of the gas and molecular weight**

- !! If gravity wins, then the atmosphere remains on the planet, but if the random motion is too motioney, then the molecules gradually leave the planet. If both of these conditions are unsatisfied, so the planet is too hot and too small, then absolutely no atmosphere can be present.

### Escape velocity
---
If we take gravity into account using [[Escape velocity]], we could see how fast the molecules should be going before they are ejected from the planet. 

### Temperature and molecule weight
---
The other factor is the random motion of gases, which depends on the temperature and molecule weight, where if the temperature is hotter the random motion is more motioney, and if the molecules are heavier the random motion is slower.

(insert proof)
We can thus approximate the speed of a gas with:$$v = 157\sqrt{\frac{T}{w}}$$
Where $T$ is the temperature and $w$ is the molecular weight of molecules. 
But, how do we know what the temperature of a planet is depending on its distance from [[The Sun]]? We do know that the farther away we are from an object, according to the [[Inverse square law]], that the light should get progressively fainter and less bright -> **closer objects are hotter, and farther objects are colder.** However, this is an extremely simple relationship.

Finally, how do we know if a terrestrial planet has an atmosphere or not? How can we determine that? Very roughly, due to [[Random motion]], molecules might get some [[Velocity]] and escape off into space even if their escape velocity is below the escape velocity of the planet. Roughly speaking:
- n  If the escape velocity is less than 6 times greater than the typical speed of the gas, all of it will escape, if it is 10 times greater then no gas escapes, and if it is between 6 and 10, then some gas escapes.
