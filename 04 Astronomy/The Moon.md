The Moon, our lovely cosmic brother, forever orbiting our planet with the same side always facing us. 

## The landscape
---
Over the surface of the moon, light colored **highlands** cover the landscape, as well as mountains and valleys, with long canyons stretching between (*rilles*). Once thought to be oceans, **maria** are dark colored and smooth across the lunar surface. It is also covered in craters, some young, some old, some on top of each other.

The ground is made of a layer called **regolith**, composed of powder and rocky rubble, as a result from meteoritic bombardment. It has no water and plenty of materials like calcium, aluminum and titanium. 

The rocks are **basalts**, made from lava. They have silicates, oxides of iron and titanium. They also contain 3 materials which aren't on earth: ***tranquilityite, armalcolite and pyrroxferroite***.

# Evolution of moon
---
The moon most likely formed around 4.5 billion years ago. Over the next 200 million years, the surface underwent melting and chemical separation, forming the base of the moon today. Then, there was a massive bombardment of meteors, which created enormous basins, craters, etc,  At around 4 billion years ago. Later, around 3.8 billion years ago, the basins filled with lava to form maria. 

But, how did the moon actually form. There are 4 potential theories:
1. FISSION: the moon broke off the Earth, but there are too many differences in the crust.
2. CAPTURE: the Earth captured a rogue very large asteroid which became the Moon, however the orbit isn't quite what it should be for this theory.
3. CONDENSATION: simply that the Moon formed alongside the Earth from similar material.
4. IMPACT TRIGGER: some large object struck the Earth and broke off a part of the mantle and crust - **best accepted model!**

# The insides
---
With the help of lunar seismology, we are able to draw some conclusions about the insides of the moon. We predict that the core has a radius of about 700 km. Since there is no magnetic field, we can say that its most likely not molten. Above the core is the mantle, and above that the crust. Since there has actually been evidence of the moon having a magnetic field in the past, we think that there is a partly molten part of the core right above it. Since the mass of the moon **isn't uniform**, but has certain **mascons**, or large concentrations of mass where volcanic lava filled the basins. This also gives us a clue that the moon isn't active and quite rigid in structure, so no tectonics.

# Constantly in motion
---
The **sidereal period** of the moon is 27.322 days, and this is the time it takes for the moon to orbit completely. Its synodic period, or period between successive phases of the moon 29.531 days. 

## Different sides of the same coin
---
The **phases** of the moon change constantly as the position of it and the sun give different shadows. The **new moon** is when the moon and sun are in sync, in *conjunction*, or their ecliptic longitudes are equal. 
- n If the moon is very close to the sun, above or below, it is a new moon.

Then, the moon begins to **wax**, becoming bigger, until it reaches the **first quarter**. The ecliptic longitudes of the moon and sun differ by 90ยบ. (right side is lit). After that, we reach the full moon, when the moon and sun are directly opposite each other from Earth. Then, it begins to wane, until we repeat the cycle all over again. 

The moon has a **synchronous rotation** with the Earth, so actually it does **show the same side towards us the entire time**. The rotation period remains constant, but the orbit follows [[Kepler's second law - the law of areas]], so sometimes we **see a bit more of the moon**, up to 59%, and this is called ***libration***. 

## Dragons and whatnot
---
Other than the classical synodic and sidereal periods, the moon still follows a classical [[Planetary orbits]]. Its inclination is 5ยบ to the ecliptic, and due to perturbations of the Earth and Sun, the **nodal line** (intersection between the ecliptic and orbital planet of the Moon) make a revolution every 18.6m years. 
- n If the ascending node is close to $\gamma$, then we can see it 28.5ยบ north or south of the equator, and when the descending node is close to $\gamma$, we can see it 18.5ยบ north/south of the equator.

So, the **draconic or nodical month** is the time of the Moon moving from one ascending node back to the next one. It lasts 27.212 days. Other than dragons, the **anomalistic month**, defined the same as Earth's anomalistic year, is around 27.555 days long.

Back to the dragons, we can also define a **draconic year**, or the time it takes for the Sun to pass through the same lunar node twice. This amounts to 364 days, 14 hours and 53 minutes.
