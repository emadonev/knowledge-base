This model depicts the [[Planetary migration in the solar system]] in the early stages of the solar system, and even thought the evidence for [[Heavy late bombardment]] is thinning, the model stuck. It starts 3.9 billion years ago. 
1. The giant planets form beyond the ice line in the solar system, where an abundance of icy asteroids, gas and material lies. Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune are born.
2. Jupiter, attracted towards the Sun migrates inwards, while the rest of the gas giants continue growing and accumulating gas
3. Saturn goes in towards the Sun to rescue Jupiter from going too far, slowing down the migration of Jupiter. Meanwhile, they take away some of the material in the inner solar system.
4. Both Jupiter and Saturn rush back towards the outer solar system, with Uranus and Neptune now also migrating outwards.
5. Today, in the region where Jupiter used to be, now lie the rocky planets, and far away lie the gas giants.
