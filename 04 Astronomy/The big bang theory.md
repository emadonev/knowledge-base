A model of the beginning of the universe where all matter and energy was created from a single point which expanded outwards at the start of time. It started out very hot and dense, and later cooled down. Matter was mostly protons, electrons and neutrons which later formed atoms. During this time electrons interacted with light so it could not travel through the universe untill it cooled down enough for it to travel, and hence form the [[Cosmic microwave background]].
