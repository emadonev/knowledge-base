As our Sun was forming, further out in the disk of spinning matter, density changes appeared. Matter started clumping awkwardly together. The clumps smashed into each other, forming larger clumps. These clumps later became the planets. Around our clumps, matter formed its own spinning disk, and more matter clumped into smaller pieces. After time, gravity smoothed all the shapes into spheres, forming the planets, and moons which orbit the planets. All of the matter which was not lucky enough to clump together, remained, scattered throughout the solar system as asteroids, comets, meteorids, scars from the birth of our universe. The first four planets are rocky and terrestrial, and the next four planets are gas and ice giants, having small cores and enourmously thick atmospheres.
