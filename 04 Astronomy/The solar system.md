Our solar system consists of our star, [[The Sun]]. Around it orbit 8 planets: [[Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Earth]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], [[Neptune]]. Other than the planets, we also have lots of [[Moons]] which orbit the planets, [[Asteroids]], [[Comets]], and [[Meteoroids]]. Beyond the planets, we have the [[Kuiper belt]], and beyond that we have the [[Oort cloud]]. Our solar system is the only system (and we have found many, many others) contains life. 

The reason our solar system has, well, "solar" in the name, is because we use the latin word **solis** to describe anything related to our sun. And since the planets orbit the sun, the system is called the solar system.

Our solar system is unique from other solar systems, because of the arrangement of our planets. We lack super Earths and hot Jupiters. This might be due to the specifics of our solar system. No other solar system has 4 inner rocky planets and 4 outer gas giants. 

The system is fairly flat, being flatter than a pancake, so pretty flat.
