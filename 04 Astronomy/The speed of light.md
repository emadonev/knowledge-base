The speed of light is how fast light travels through a medium.

## Calculation of the speed of light
-----
This calculation was first attempted in 1675, by the Danish astronomer Ole Roemer. He was looking at the moons of Jupiter, and he could predict the time that eclipses would occur. However, he noticed that when Earth was close to Jupiter that it took less time for eclipses to happen, and the opposite was true.
- pr He discovered that light isn't instantaneous, and that the difference in time is the speed of light! 
So, he calculated that it took 22 minutes for light to cross the diameter of Earth's orbit. He calculated the speed of light to be $2.2 * 10^8 ms^{-1}$. Later, the speed of light in a **vacuum** was defined as $2.99792458 * 10^8 ms^{-1}$
