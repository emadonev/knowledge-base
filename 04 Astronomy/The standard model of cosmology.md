The standard model of cosmology tells us that at the beginning there was a Big Bang, arond 13.8 billion years ago. At the time, the universe was very hot and dense, and with time it expanded and cooled. Every fluctuation in temperature in the early universe might result in the formation of galaxies and stars. The model is founded on the assumption that over the whole universe that it is homogeneous and isotropic (all of the properties are quite similar everywhere) and that there are no prefered directions in space (no ups or downs, lefts or rights). 

We have had to add to the model ==dark matter and dark energy== to match theory to observation. These two properties are not very well known today, and there is still much ongoing research.
