Variable stars are stars whose brightness varies in intensity. The reason why the brightness changes is because they expand and contract, and during this transformation, due to the luminosity equation, brightness changes. The reason why stars pulsate in the first place is because **they are not in hydrostatic equilibrium**. Gravity and pressure keep fighting one another, but always overshooting when trying to correct one another's mistakes. These changes can be **periodic, semiregular or irregular.** The periods are measured in [[Julian Dates]], and the **period** is the time period between 2 equal magnitudes. 

Every star is in one sense or another is a variable star, because the brightness is never absolutely constant!

The larger the star used to be in the main sequence, the more their [[Luminosity]] changes! The pulsating becomes more pronounced! 

The most common magnitudes used here are [[Visual magnitudes]], [[Photographic magnitudes]] and [[UBV photoelectric magnitudes]]. 

Using [[The Doppler effect]] we can see how the star's surface pulsates and find out about its characteristics like the change in color and volume.

We differentiate different variable stars based on **their periods and shapes of their light curves**.

Variable stars are typically at the ends of their lifetimes. They are located in the instability strip of the HR diagram, which shows that in stages where nuclear fusion is unstable and fuel is running our, the star itself stars variating. 

## Intrinsic variable stars
- the star itself changes brightness
### Pulsating stars
- these stars expand and contract cyclically, in the **fundamental mode of pulsation**. These stars shrink and expand periodically, and due to the change in size, the brightness changes also! Stars can pulsate in 2 different ways: **radially**, so their size increases and decreases periodically, or **non-radially** which means they pulsate by changing their shape! The process of the pulsation is described by the [[Eddington valve]].

	- [[W Virginis (CW) variables]]
	- [[RR Lyrae]]
	- [[RV Tauri]]
	- [[Long period variables (LVP)]] 
	- [[Delta-scuti variables (DSCT)]]
	- [[Sx Phoenix variables]]

### Cataclysmic stars
- these types of stars include stars which undergo sudden outbursts of energy, resulting in a rapid increase in brightness
	- [[Supernova]]
	- [[Novas]]
	- [[Recurrent novas]]
	- [[Dwarf Novas]]
	- [[Symbiotic stars]]
	- [[R Coronae Borealis]]

### Eruptive variable stars
- these stars have magnitude changes because of flares or shell ejections
	- [[Flare stars]]
	- [[S Doradus stars]]
	- [[Wolf-Rayet stars]]
	- and others
### Young stellar objects
- [[T Tau variables]]
- [[FU Orionis variables]]
- [[EXor variables]]
- [[UXor variables]]
### X-ray variable stars
- these are stars which are in a binary system where the other companion is a neutron star or a black hole

## Extrinsic VS
- the star itself is not changing, but due to external influences the brightness or [[Luminosity]] is changing
### 1. [[Eclipsing variables]]
### 2. Rotating variables
- these variable stars have variation caused by starspots, magnetism, or because they shange shape
	- [[Pulsars]]
	- [[Ellipsoidal stars (ELL)]]
	- [[Magnetic variables]]
	- [[BY Dra variables]]
	- [[RS CVn variables]]
	- [[Gamma Cas stars]]
### 3. Microlensing variables
- these variables brighten and fade when some object which acts as a gravitational lens passes in front from our POV, which magnifies the star's light.

## Other types!
- [[Gamma-ray burst stars]]
- [[Active galactic nuclei]]

### O - C diagrams(Observed minus Calculated diagram)
These diagrams represent the difference of observed time of minimum and maximum brightness (O) with the calculated time (C). The graph's axes look like this: the cycle number E (or time) on the x-axis and the (O-C) values on the y-axis. 

There can be a few forms to these diagrams:
1. If the period of the star is constant and equal to P -> horizontal line
2. If the period of the star is constant and different from P -> straight line, where $a = ∆P$
3. If the period is constant, and the abruptly changes to another period -> broken straight lines
4. Period changes at a changing rate -> parabola, $a = \frac{ß}{2P}$
5. If the system is a binary star, due to gravity the minima and maxima oscillate in a stable way, creating a sinusoidal pattern
