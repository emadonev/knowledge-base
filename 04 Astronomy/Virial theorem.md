> Every system in equilibrium has the property where **half of the time averaged potential energy is equal to the kinetic energy.**

Let's say we have a system where a small mass was orbiting a bigger mass $m, M$, at some distance $r$. The potential energy is then:$$U = -\frac{GmM}{r}$$
In a cluster, dynamically relaxed system, etc. we can imagine that an object is orbiting the centre of the system which has the total mass.

If the particle is *in orbit*, its total energy is then:$$T(r) = \frac{mv^2}{2}$$, where $v = \sqrt{GM/r}$, and so:$$T(r) = \frac{GMm}{2r} = 
\frac{-U}{2}$$
Then, the total energy is:$$E = T(r) + U(r) = \frac{U(r)}{2}$$, and so
>$$E = \frac{1}{2}U$$
