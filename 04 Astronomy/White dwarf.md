These stars are the remains of [[Stars]] which undergo [[Stellar old age]] from low mass stars. 

They are composed of mostly carbon and oxygen, and temperatures are not high enough for further fusion. 

- n White dwarfs form when fusion ceases in low mass stars, and the remains of it keep collapsing (since there is no nuclear pressure keeping hydrostatic equilibrium ([[Stellar structure]])), until *it becomes so dense that the gas becomes **degenerate***.

- eg **Degenerate gas** is a gas where fermions are forced into very high energy states due to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]. In the case of white dwarfs, we have *electron degenerate gas*, where electrons cannot be forced closer than the exclusion principle allows, building up *degenerate pressure*, which counterbalances gravity - enabling a stable dwarf.

Due to the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]], we can see that due to very high density of the white dwarf, the *change in position is very very small*, hence *momentum **could** be very high*. These electrons then have great energy, supporting the star.

From [[Momentum]] and pressure equations, and extensive knowledge about [[Atoms]], we can derive a formula for degenerate pressure, which is just an estimate. 
- f $$P = 2(\frac{h}{2\pi})^2\;(\frac{Z}{A})^{5/3}\;(\frac{\rho}{m_p})^{5/3}\;\frac{1}{m_e}$$

Where $h$ is the planck constant, $Z$ is the [[Protons]] ([[Electron]]) number, $A$ is the nucleus mass, $\rho$ is the average density, $m_p$ is the mass of a proton, and $m_e$ is the mass of an electron. And, the electron density of the white dwarf is related to the average density:
- f $$n_e = \frac{Z}{A}\;\frac{\rho}{m_p}$$

We can also say that the pressure of a white dwarf (using [[Thermodynamics]]) is:
- f $$P = (Z+1)n_ekT$$

Finally, using the fact that the pressure and gravity are approximately equal since the star is stable, we can see that:
- f $$P = \frac{GM^2}{R^4}$$

or 
- f $$GRM^{1/3} = 2\;\frac{h^2}{4\pi m_e}\;(\frac{Z}{4A\;m_p})^{5/3}$$

White dwarfs die slowly, as they don't have a new source of energy, energy they have keeps depleting, photons taking the energy slowly away. The star has a constant size, and since they have a low opacity and high thermal conductivity, the inside is very hot (around 10^7 K), while the surface around 10^4, which gives them their spectral type.

After a veeeery long period of time, they become to black to see, hence the name, **black dwarf.** 

### Chandrasekhar limit
---
Physicist S. Chandrasekhar realized that we need to account for **relativistic effects** inside the degenerate cores of white dwarfs, as [[Electron]]s couldn't move faster than the speed of light - hence there is an upper limit to the mass of a white dwarf. 

This is called the **Chandrasekhar limit, and is equal to around 1.44 solar masses.** 

## Planetary nebulas
---
While we don't know much about the mechanism of how planetary nebulas form, they are a beautiful sight, and their colors come from the ionization of elements which are released in shells from the white dwarf. 

The 0.1 solar mass found in these nebulas at temperatures of around 100000 K are used up for future stars as they form!
