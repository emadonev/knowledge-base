X rays are very tricky, as they are completely blocked by the Earth's atmosphere (good for us, not good for telescopes), but also X-rays penetrate most ordinary matter, so they tend to go **through mirrors instead of being reflected**. So, the only way that it gets reflected is by ==letting the waves graze the mirrors at a very small angle==.

The most famous X ray telescope is th **Chandra telescope**, built by the nested mirrors system. X rays are usually released by super high energy processes in the universe, as seen by the optical vs. the x ray version of the orion nebula.

The detector for x-rays is called *Geiger-MÃ¼ller counter*, which uses cathodes and [[Electron]]s to create a current and form an image. When a quanta of X-rays enters the counter filled with gas, the gas ionizes, and the potential difference between the anode and cathode make a current, which we later analyze into a picture.
