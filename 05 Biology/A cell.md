# What is a cell? In short
---
In short, a **cell** is the most fundamental building block of life, and each cell has a **specialized function within the body**, which is why they come in different shapes, sizes and with different functions. The science of cells is called *cytology.*

# Cell theory - where do cells come from?
---
Now, back in the day, it was thought that cells came out of nowhere, or that they *spontaneously formed in the wild*, which we now know is ridiculous due to the work of **Louis Pasteur.** He conducted an experiment where he tested two samples of material which both had the potential for microorganisms. One was sealed off from the environment, and the other had access to air. The flask with access to air developed microbial life, while the other didn't. So, **cells had to come from other cells**, they couldn't just spontaneously show up.

In the 19th century, Matthias Jakob Schleiden and Theodor Schwann created **cell theory**, which stated that a cell was fundamental, that every being was made of 1 or more cells, and that cells come from other cells. 

> Another scientist, Rudolf Virchow, said that *"Omnis cellula e cellula* - every cell from a cell.

We have multiple types of cells, including:
- [[Procaryote cell]]
