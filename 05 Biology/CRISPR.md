CRISPR is a revolutionary new technology regarding [[Gene editing]]. CRISPR are gene strands which are used to detect unfamiliar viruses and other organisms who are atacking. The protein Cas9, CRISPR associated protein 9, uses a RNA version of the CRISPR sequence to identify a virus which atacked before, finding the sequence and effectively destroying it by brutal cutting.

Scientists have used CRISPR and Cas9 to treat human diseases in the following way. They would take a sequence of DNA for some disease, put it on Cas9 and basically tell it to search for a match. Once Cas9 finds a match to the sequence it was given, it destroys or cuts out that particular part of the DNA. Moreover, we can stich our custom DNA sequence to Cas9 so that when it destroys the targeted genetic sequence, it gives a blueprint to the cell so it can repair the DNA in the exact way we want. 

Using CRISPR-Cas9 we can modify any genetic code to our liking. This brings up quite a few ethical questions regarding using CRISPR. The general opinion is that CRISPR should be used to treat medical conditions such as sickle cell disease, Alzheimers, cancer, etc.
