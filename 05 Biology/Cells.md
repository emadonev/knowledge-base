Cells are...



## Evolution of complex cells
------
- back when life was evolving, it was normal for organisms to swallow one another and gain various properties from this
- we think that 2 billion years ago, only **prokaryotes** existed
- there were **3 types of prokaryotes** back then
    -  simple blob which *absorbed organisms by enveloping them with their membranes*
    -  bacteria like object that did *photosynthesis*
    - another *used oxygen to break down sugar and released energy*
- **Endosymbiosis**: cells living together where each components has a function so everyone can live together
- if the 3 above mentioned cells merged together they became complex cells, able to live fully on their own and produce their own food. the first type became the cell as we know today, the second type became chloroplast and the third type mitochondria
- 3 pieces of evidence for the **endosymbiosis theory**:
    1. the chloroplasts and mitochondria multiply in the same way as those ancient bacteria did, and we know that because the ancient stuff still exists!
    2. both chloroplasts and mitochondria have their own DNA and ribosomes
    3. both of the organisms have 2 membranes; the inner and outer membranes. The inner membranes are the original membranes of chloroplasts and mitochondria, and their outer membranes are the same as the engulfer cell
