Organic molecules are [[Formula unit]]s which are essential for life!

Life in [[Earth]] is **carbon based**, meaning that most organic molecules are based on exactly carbon!

# Evolution of organic molecules
-----
Things probably started off really easy: small molecules containing carbon in the atmosphere started bonding together into slightly more complicated molecules. There is a hypothesis which was proved by **Miller and Urey in 1955** where they simulated the atmosphere in the past and its conditions, and when the gases were exposed to lightning they found complex organic molecules. This meant that we could synthesize complex organic molecules out of inorganic ones.

It is stipulated that RNA formed before DNA, since proteins are required for DNA as well.

However, it would be difficult to create polymers in the atmosphere of the Earth, meaning that they were probably synthesized in water, near hydrothermal vents ([[The origin of life]]). However, it is very difficult to create proteins and very complex molecules in water because water wants to break them down.
