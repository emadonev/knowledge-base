A procaryote cell is around $0.2 - 10 \mu m$ in length. While they might seem simple, they are very complicated in cellular structure.

## Cell membrane

![[cell membrane.png]]
The cellular membrane is built out of **phospholipids**, large molecules made up of a *head and a tail*, where the ***head is hydrophilic and the tail hydrophobic***. This kind of love-hate relationship with water makes for a sturdy barrier where the heads are outwards, allowing bacteria to thrive in water environments since they can interact with their surroundings, but the constant bilateralness allows for a constant shape. The phospholipids, combined with **proteins** make for a **selective permeability of cells.** Proteins get to decide which nutrients, ions, and big molecules are needed for the cell, and allow safe passage inside, or they get rid of waster from inside the cell. Harmful stuff and big molecules cannot get into the cell by themselves. 

> Small disturbances in the membrane called **mezosomes** also exist in some procaryotes, however we still don't know why they occur or what they are for.

## Cell wall
---
This structure is made of peptidoglycan, which creates a mesh outside of the cellular membrane and keeps the shape of the cell and protects it from the environment and harmful stuff, and it also keeps the bacteria from exploding due to *osmotic pressure*. We divide bacteria into **gram positive and gram negative bacteria**, where the former has a thick layer of pepti, and the latter a thin one. G+ become a crystal violet color under the microscope, because when we inject dye it really doesn't want to get out of the pepti. For G-, the thin layer cannot retain the dye, so its a red color. This staining method was created in 1884 by Hans Christian Gram, to differentiate different types of bacteria to help for diseases. 

Another fact is that G+ bacteria are **much more susceptible to damage**. Even though it is counterintuitive, since they have a thicker layer of protective material. However, this is costly, since then the bacteria *doesn't have an outer layer*, so penicillin and other antibiotics can take apart the mesh of the pepti quickly.

G- bacteria, while having a thinner layer of pepti, have a reinforced outer layer, making them much better at protecting themselves from antibiotics.

## Capsules
---
Speaking of outer layers on non-gram-negative bacteria, we have a **capsule**. They are made of polysaccharides, very long sugars,  or sometimes protein. Bacteria have it due to many reasons:
1. For their own protection and safety in *harsh environments* - however if ==bacteria aren't in such an environment, it is to costly to have a capsule==
2. Since the main job of these bacteria is to attack a host, they *need the layer for adhesion to the surface of tissue and to protect themselves from the immune system* - if a bacteria is just chilling, it doesn't need this layer
3. Finally, some bacteria just use it for extra storage!

## Ribosomes&DNA&cytoplasm
---
These are the main components of a cell, since they keep everything running smoothly. The **cytoplasm** is a gel-like substance which fills up the cell. Its made of:
- *proteins* - enzymes for chemical reactions - since there are no mitochondria, cellular respiration is done in the cytoplasm
- *nucleic acids* - ribosomes + nucleoid region
- *ions*, salts, sugars, amino acids, 
- *macromolecules* - structural proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates

Inside the cytoplasm, we have a bunch of little **ribosomes**, which are created directly from the cytoplasm. These are small structures where using **mRNA**, they create new protein!! They contain ***rRNA***, which helps create ribosomes in the first place, and then they analyze the mRNA. They get this from the cytoplasm. Since there is no nucleus but rather just a tangle of DNA called a **nucleoid**, the synthesis of mRNA, transfer to a ribosome is very efficient. Ribosomes create proteins which are *necessary for general functions of the cell!!!!* 

> Why don't bacteria have a nucleus?

Well, since procaryotes are evolutionarly less advanced than eukaryotes, they didn't have time to evolve a nucleus, plus the super efficient DNA to mRNA process was good enough for bacteria! Although, without the nucleus, DNA is much more likely to get damaged. But, these cells have different mechanisms for repairing DNA, they have proteins which help pack the DNA nicely into its own nucleoid region, plus as an extra bonus, since bacteria tend to stay in one place and try to colonize another organism, there isn't that much risk of damage since it is a controlled environment. 

An interesting fact is that some bacteria have **plasmids**, which are small fragmented parts of DNA, transferred from cell to cell, which help for *antibiotic, heavy metal, etc. resistance!*
