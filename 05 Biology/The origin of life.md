Scientists think that life began on [[Earth]] around 4.4 billion years ago in hydrothermal vents in the oceans. They think that it arose from elementary [[Formula unit]] and [[Atoms]] such as:
- Hydrogen
- Phosphates
- Nitrogen
- Carbon dioxide
- Methane
- Ammonia

These are the necessary components for life, without them life cannot exist. In order for them to come together to make life, they need to be in a liquid substance: **water!!** 

- pr **Why are hydrothermal vents the perfect place for life?** Because if something wanted to live on land, it couldn't due to the Sun's extreme UV light and the surfaces hostility. The best place where there is no radiation but still heat and an abundance of minerals and the necessary elements and compounds is near a hydrothermal vent!

- LUCA: last universal common ancestor: this is as far back as we can trace life on Earth. We don’t know what LUCA looked like, but we know it existed!
- we found out our LUCA genes by searching for common DNA found in all life forms: archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes. These shared genes must have come from some common ancestor, such is LUCA.
    - from this analysis we discovered that LUCA lived in a very hot environment and got energy via chemical reactions, similar to stuff found around hydrothermal vents! This is great evidence for the hypothesis that life formed around these vents.
- there are 2 types of vents:
    - ****************************black smokers:**************************** dark plumes rise from the vents, which are acidic and rich in carbon dioxide, hundreds of degrees hot, and rich in sulphur, iron, copper and other metals. Recent evidence suggests that these types of vents were too hot for life
    - ****************************white smokers:**************************** here white plumes rise which are alkaline, rich in methane, calcium and have a lower temperature
- the best location we have for life is the ************lost city,************ or the midatlantic ridge in the middle of the Atlantic. there are plenty of white smokers which are perfect for life, as well as black smokers which provide necessary metals and CO2.

However:
 >"*Hydrothermal vents tend to be short-lived, lasting perhaps only hundreds of years4 — timescales so short that the origin of life at undersea vents has been said to be “essentially akin to spontaneous generation.”*" - [Evolution news](https://evolutionnews.org/2022/09/forming-polymers-a-problem-for-the-origin-of-life/) 

Lots of evidence points against hydrothermal vents (too alkaline, too short lived, etc.) and lots of evidence points against land. So, where did life really form? We still don't know. 

After inanimate matter formed animate matter or life, [[Cells]] were made, and the evolution of those cells gave rise to life today. But, before [[Protobionts or protocells]] were made, [[Organic molecules]] had to be made first! The sequence probably went like this:
- ex INORGANIC MOLECULES $\ce{->}$   ORGANIC MOLECULES (aminoacids, sugars, nuclides) $\ce{->}$ POLYMERS(lipids, complex sugars,...) $\ce{->}$ PROTOBIONTS (makeshift version of cells) $\ce{->}$ FORMATION OF RNA (now the protobionts can replicate) $\ce{->}$ THE FIRST CELLS
