[[A cell]] is pretty tiny, so we needed to create new and innovative ways to research them, look at them and do experiments with them. 
# Microscopes
---
The first most obvious choice is a **microscope.** They are the successors of [[Telescopes]], as a similar optical mechanism is applied to make the very small much bigger. 

## A tiny history
---
The first scientist to discover cellular structure (1665) was **Robert Hooke**, who improved a simple microscope with 3 lenses and a stage light. He put cork under the microscope and found tiny little "pores" which later became *cells.* 

Not long after Hooke, **Antonie van Leeuwenhoek** further improved the telescope with an eyepiece, objective, and magnifications of up to 200-300 times the original size. With this cool new scope, he managed to discover *bateria and protozoa*, which he called "animacules." He looked at a smear of blood, sperm, the plaque between teeth, etc. He is also referred to as **the father of microbiology.** 

After these 2 pioneers, later research came way later in the 19th century, where German scientists Theodore Schwann and Mattias Schleiden discovered that *we have 2 different types of cells (animal and plant)*. After them, in the 1880s, Walter Sutton and Theodor Boveri discovered the presence of **chromosomes** and connected hereditary properties with it and cells.

Now, **optical microscopes** are very useful and have pioneered microbiology and cytology. They are composed of:
- an eyepiece (okular)
- objective lenses (objektiv)
- Revolver
- coarse adjustment knobs (makrovijak)
- fine adjustment knob (mikrovijak)
- stage (stolic)
- light source
- condenser (kondenzor)
- mechanical stage (stalak)

These microscopes are based off of light, and they have the exact same 2 principles of telescopes:
1. **Magnifying power**
2. **Resolution of 2 objects**

The total mag power is the power of the eyepiece multiplied by the power of the objective, both of which are gained through focal lengths. The resolution is a similar formula to telescopes:
>$$d = 1.22\frac{\lambda}{n\sin\mu}$$  , where $n$ is the refraction index of the lens, $d$ is the distance of resolution (not angles as in   telescopes) and $\mu$ is half the angle of incoming light.

They have the power to magnify up to 3000 times the original size, and a resolution of 0.2-0.5 $\mu m$. 

A more powerful variant is the **electron microscope** which uses electrons to formulate an image from fixed specimens which are dyed with heavy metals. There are 2 types: *SEM* and *TEM*, where the first one scans with electrons, creating a projecting image, while the other transmits electrons through the sample. These microscopes have a magnification of 1000000 times the original size and $0.2-0.5\;nm$ resolution. 

We used the electron microscope to discover viruses!

### Cell fractionation
This procedure tries to take out organelles and the components of cells while still retaining their function so they can be better analyzed. 
1. Tissue is put into a test tube and mechanically the cell membrane is destroyed. We add [[Pufer]] so that the organelles would stay intact. (*Homogenizacija*)
2. Next the tissue is subject to **extreme centrifuge** where after 10 mins the nuclei and cellular remains are at the bottom. The stuff above is centrifuged again.
	1. 15 mins - mitochondria, plastids, lizosomes
	2. 60 mins - plasma membrane and membrane of organelles
	3. Finally, ribosomes are at the bottom!

### Radioactive tracking (Autoradiografija)
---
This process (seen in doctor House in one episode) uses a radioactive isotope to **tag a specific cell type** and then using other instruments we can track medicine, specific cells, etc. inside a living body and observe its function.

### Cultures!
---
Again, as seen in dr. House, growing cultures is a tedious process, but it tells us what bacteria or cells are present in a sample, body, etc. Growing small cultures enables us to analyze many different cells and their properties.
