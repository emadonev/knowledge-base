- extremely small
- made up of a nucleus and electron cloud
	- the [[Nucleus]] contains [[Protons]] and [[Neutrons]], protons being positively charged and neutrons have no charge
	- the electron cloud is where things get complicated:
		- the position of an [[Electron]] cannot be precisely pinpointed because of [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] and we try to map their path using the [[Schrödinger wave equation]]. These maps of the wave equation depict [[orbitals]] where each can contain 2 electrons. Each orbital has the following parameters: [[Angular momentum quantum number]], [[Magnetic quantum number]] and [[Principal quantum number]]. Electrons obide the laws of [[Electron spin]] and the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] when they are put into the electron orbitals. Each orbital has a different shape and is placed in [[Electron shell]]. Each shell contains a certain number of orbitals of electrons. There are 4 types of orbitals: [[S-orbitals]], [[P-orbitals]], [[D-orbitals]] and [[F-orbitals]]. Together they form different [[Electron configurations]]. We can write down an electron configuration using the [[Aufbau principle]]. 
		- Each atom has 2 properties related to electrons: [[Electron affinity]] and [[Ionization energy]]. 

- atoms can ==bond== together, forming everything around us!
- [[Ionic bonds]] and [[Covalent bond]] and *Metal bonds*

## History of the atom
-----
So, we all know what atoms look like now, right? There have been many models for atoms in the past, starting from ancient Greece, when Democritus described the atom as an indivisible particle of which everything around us is made of. While this was just speculation, he was proven to be on the correct path many years later.

Then, John Dalton proposed the atom’s existence based on his experiments with gasses. He discovered that different types of atoms exist and make up compounds we can find in everyday life.

Then, the [[Plum-pudding model]] came in. Afterwards, Ernest Rutherford's famous [[Gold-foil experiment]] was done. Then, the [[Planetary model of the atom]] was made by Neils Bohr. And, as of today we know that electrons are found in the **electron cloud, described above.**
