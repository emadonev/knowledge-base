Chemistry is all about atoms and how they create the world around us. However, in order to understand the world at such an atomic scale, we need some form of measurement of things like size, mass, etc. 

At first it was thought that the atomic mass of an element was its defining quality, but when [[Isotopes]] were discovered, it appeared not to be so. Now, the atomic mass became the weighted average of the isotopes found in nature.

Chemists' atomic weights are slightly different than the atomic mass. These are weights where isotopes are ignored if their quantity is small enough. Physicists didn't like this, so they created their own scale, the **Physical atomic weights** where the mass of the oxygen 16 isotope is 16.0000, and based on this a new scale was made. They updated everything so they took into account the tiny mass differences due to isotopes. 

Because chemists and physicists were fighting over their tables, they came to a compromise. 

Now we use something called an **atomic mass unit (amu), and today we use Unified atomic mass (u).** 
- n $$u = 1.660540 * 10^{-27} kg$$
- n $$proton = 1u$$
- n $$neutron = 1u$$*approximately*


With *u* we connect atomic mass with kg, with which we are all familiar with. However, why is the value the way it is? Because scientists agreed that *u* is equal to 1/12th the mass of a neutral C-12 atom, instead of the Oxygen 16 atom. 

- pr Not all elements have an atomic mass in the definition mentioned beforehand. Elements up until 83 are naturally occurring on Earth, so we can find their isotopes and measure everything. For higher elements this becomes difficult since they are radioactive ([[Radioactive decay]]). So, we say that *the atomic mass is the mass number of the most long-lived isotope.* 


## Relative atomic mass
-------
[[Atoms]] are composed of [[Electron]]s, protons and neutrons. However, since electrons have a much, much, much smaller mass than protons and neutrons, the atomic mass is mainly made of protons and neutrons. So, we can define the atomic mass as summing up the number of protons and neutrons in the core (since both are approximately 1u). The average atomic mass is the weighted average of all the [[Isotopes]] of a particular element. In the [[Periodic table of elements]], the number below the symbol is often represented as the average atomic mass, but without the *u* afterward, it is actually the **relative atomic mass**, so its value is relative to other elements. 

# Mass spectrograph
We can precisely measure the mass of each [[Isotopes]] using a [[Mass spectrograph]]. These are complex machines with simple logic behind them! We use a bit of [[Statistics]] and [[Inertia]].
