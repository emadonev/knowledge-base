There are many types of chemical reactions. The most famous ones are the ones where everything seems to go in **one direction**. We have some reactants, something happens, and we get some products. The end. However, there is another type, where if we want, we can turn the product *back into the reactants*. This is a reversible reaction. 

> But what if a reaction is both at the same time?

Let's say that we have substances A and B. After a while of A turning into B, their concentrations, amount of stuff ([[The mole and Avogadro's number]]), comes to an **equilibrium.** This reaction is a ***BALANCED REACTION.*** Even though macroscopically nothing appears to be happening, on a molecular level, the reaction is constantly going back and forth, at the same speed, with the same quantity of stuff, keeping *the total balance in balance.* We can gather the chemical reaction by calculating the stechiometric coefficients, by:$$\nu = \frac{\Delta n}{\xi}$$
We also define a **constant of balance** which describes the nature of a particular system we are observing. How do we get a balanced reaction?
1. the speed of the forward and backward reactions *has to be the same*
2. the total concentration doesn't change

What do we need in order for this to happen? 
1. The reaction **has to be reversible.**
	1. in other words, if a reaction is *too exothermic*, then there is to little energy remaining for the products to convert back into the reactants. if the products have enough energy, they can reverse back!
	2. if the structure of a particular component is *too complex*, then it will be waaay to difficult for it to be assembled back together - the simpler, the better
2. the **system has to be closed!**
3. along the last point, the environment has to be stable an constant
