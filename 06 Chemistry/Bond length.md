The ideal distance between two atomic nuclei where there is minimum energy!
- if the atoms are too far away, the electrons desperately want to get to the nucleus of the other atom
- if they are too close, the like charges of the nuclei repel each other 

==Force of attraction = -Force of repeling?==
