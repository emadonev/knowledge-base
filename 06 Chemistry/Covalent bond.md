- bonds between two or more nonmetals or metalloids
	- they hold their electrons tighter towards the nucleus than other atoms hence they would not give them up but rather share them
- each atom shares its electrons with the other atom
- both are attracted to the shared electrons and they form a **covalent bond**

## Polar covalent bond
- the two atoms in question have different electronegativities, causing [[Polarity]]!

## Nonpolar covalent bond
- the electronegativites of the two charges are identical in the example of Cl2, or they are very close to one another so there is no [[Polarity]]
