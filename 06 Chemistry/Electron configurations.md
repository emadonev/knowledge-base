An example of electron configuration of oxygen

$1s^22s^22p^4$

- the letters (s and p) represent the types of orbitals, the superscripts represent the number of electrons in each orbital and the numbers before the letters represent the energy level 
- the number of electrons possible in the outermost shell minus the actual number of electrons there determines the reactivity of the atom!
- the number of electrons in the outermost layer are called valence electrons
