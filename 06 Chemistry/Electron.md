**Electrons** are leptons, particles that aren’t influenced by strong interactions. In other words, they aren’t affected by the strong force. They are very stable, too. They can’t break down since they aren’t made up of any other particle.

- they are a wave particle duality
- electrons are standing waves: the wave part of the duality
	-  the [[Schrödinger wave equation]] describes the nodes of an electron as it orbits around the nucleus

	- we cannot know precisley where an electron is and its speed at the same time due to the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]]
