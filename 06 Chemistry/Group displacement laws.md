Scientist Soddy proposed these laws in 1913. for [[Alpha decay]], [[Beta decay]] and [[Gamma decay]] to describe how they change the parent [[Atoms]]. During a [[Radioactive decay]] sequence, we encounter different [[Isotopes]] during either **$\alpha$ decay or $\beta$ decay**, or <mark style="background: #A3C4BC;">Isomers</mark> for **$\gamma$ decay**. 
- eg These are nuclei with the same atomic weight and number but with differing energy levels. 

In these branches we can have
- pr **BRANCHED DISINTEGRATION**: a type of series where one atom can have multiple ways of disintegrating, it can undergo different types of decays. Experimentally, we can show the [[Probability distributions]] of each branch, and hence which will happen more often.
- pr **NORMAL DISINTEGRATION**: a type of series where every atom has one way of disintegrating, from one radioactive atom, to a stable one.
