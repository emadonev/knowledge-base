The heisenberg uncertainty principle states that:
we cannot precisely know the exact location and momentum of an electron **at the same time!**
- We can know only one of each property precisely
- Werner Heisenberg stated the principle and was one of the youngest people ever to recieve the Nobel Prize for his discovery

- f $$\Delta p\Delta x >= \frac{h}{2\pi}$$

Where $\Delta p$ is the change in [[Momentum]], and $\Delta x$ is the change in position ([[Velocity]]).
