- Where nonmetals and metals bond
- the nonmetal takes one (or more) electrons from the metal atom because they are more willing to let go of their atoms: metals have a loose outer electron shell
- the nonmetal becomes an anion and the metal a cation
- because of their opposite charges and [[Coloumbs law]] they stick together into an **ionic bond**
