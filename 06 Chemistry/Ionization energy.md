The energy required to tear away an electron from the outermost shell in order to create an ion
- why the outermost shell?
	- because they are farthest from the nucleus and according to [[Coloumbs law]] their attraction is smaller hence it is easier for it to get removed
	- more energy is needed for electrons which are closer to the nucleus, and there is always a large jump when we cross from shell to shell!
		- atoms will be **isoelectrically** the same as another atom ==noble gases== because they have the same number of electrons, however noble gases are the most stable atoms and a lot of energy is reqired to threaten that stableness
