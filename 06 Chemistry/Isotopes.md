Isotopes are different versions of atoms with varying numbers of neutrons in the core. Every atom has a "few versions" with varying neutron quantities, and the number in the [[Periodic table of elements]] below the symbol for the element is the [[Average atomic mass]] of all the different isotopes based on their quantities in nature.
