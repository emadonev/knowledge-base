These devices calculate the mass of [[Isotopes]] and [[Atoms]] using [[Statistics]] and [[Inertia]]! 

- ex In nature, almost every element* has an isotope. They are not evenly distributed in nature, which means we use [[Probability distributions]] of the [[Distribution]] of every isotope of a particular element in nature so that our **sample** in the mass spectrograph matches the **population.** ([[Population and sample]]) 

While the spectrograph is much more complicated than the following explanation (which will come soon), this explanation provides key concepts which tell us how it works in essence.

So, when the isotopes go through the spectrograph, the charges within the atom are attracted towards a magnet. The heavier they are, the more they will resist the change in path and curve less, and the lighter they are the more they will curve their path. <mark style="background: #BABD8D;">These slight changes in paths when they hit a detection screen allow us to precisely calculate the mass of each isotope</mark>!
