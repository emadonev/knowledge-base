This part of the [[Atoms]] is composed of [[Neutrons]] and [[Protons]], bound together by the [[Strong nuclear force]]. The nucleus is central to [[Nuclear physics]], and exhibits certain [[Properties of nuclei]]. It took scientists a while to discover that the atom had a nucleus and electron cloud, as well as what was inside the nucleus.

# Discovery of the nucleus
------
The discovery of the nucleus was facilitated by the famous [[Gold-foil experiment]]! 

# Discovery of nucleus' constituents
------
Now, it wasn’t known that the nucleus contained protons and neutrons. Since neutrons weren’t discovered, scientists first thought it was made of protons and [[Electron]]s. This soon proved wrong when the nucleus’s supposed **[[Quantum spin]]** didn’t match experiments, and the nucleus was too heavy to be made of protons and electrons. Thus, we found a heavy particle with no charge: neutrons.

So, the nucleus was made of protons and neutrons and was super dense compared to the size of the atom. However, it wasn’t known why electrons didn’t collapse towards the nucleus. It seems logical, right? The positive charge of the protons in the nucleus is attracted to the negative charge of the electrons orbiting the nucleus. And yet, atoms exist. This is because of some super weird properties of electrons in the realm of [[Quantum physics]]. 

## Stability and structure of the nucleus
------
The nucleus contains neutrons, which have no charge, and protons, which have a positive charge. Due to charge, **protons will repel each other furiously**, meaning the atom cannot exist! And yet, it does. How come?

The neutrons act as guards for the protons, essentially keeping them in check from falling apart. The [[Strong nuclear force]] is an attractive force that is extremely strong, much more than the [[Electromagnetic force]], which enables the “same charges repel” law. However, the larger the nucleus, the more neutrons are required to keep the protons from repelling each other too far since there are more and more of them.

After a while, the ratio of neutrons vs. protons isn’t 1:1 anymore since more neutrons are required to keep things in balance. The graph below shows the **stability strip** or the strip of atoms where the ratio is good enough for the nucleus to stay stable. Too many neutrons, too few neutrons vs. protons, or simply too many neutrons and protons can lead to **instability.** **All known [[Isotopes]] except the ones on the red line in the graph below are unstable, or radioactive**.

There are 2 models for nuclear structure: [[Liquid drop model]] and the [[Shell model]]. In reality, neither model is absolutely correct, and we use a combination of both models for our calculations.
