- every orbital has its own specific shape based on the probabilty density of electron locations
- every orbital has 3 parameters which determine its properties
	1. [[Angular momentum quantum number]]
	2. [[Magnetic quantum number]]
	3. [[Principal quantum number]]
- there are 4 types of orbitals:
	1. [[S-orbitals]]
	2. [[P-orbitals]]
	3. [[D-orbitals]]
	4. [[F-orbitals]]
