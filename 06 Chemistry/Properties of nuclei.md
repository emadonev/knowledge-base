In all [[Atoms]] we have the [[Electron]]s, protons and neutrons(called **nucleons**). The physics of nuclei is called [[Nuclear physics]]. 

# Radius
-------
The nucleus of an atom is many, many times smaller than the **radius of the atom**, as seen by Rutherford's experiments. We can compute the radius of the nucleus with the following formula:
$$R = R_0A^{\frac{1}{3}}$$
Where $R$ is the radius of the nucleus, $R_0$ is an experimentally determined constant which is equal to $1.2 * 10^{-15}m$. Finally, $A$ is the number of nucleons in the nucleus, or the **[[Average atomic mass]](mass number)**. It is important to note that all of the masses we are talking about here are **rest masses**! 

# Density
-------
When we think about it, every nucleus follows the same formula for volume, which is very closely tied to $A$. Also, the mass of the nucleus is directly proportional to $A$. When the $A$ terms cancel, we see that **all atoms have approximately the same density!** 

# Nuclear spins
---------
The nucleons ([[Protons]] and [[Neutrons]]) also have spin, just like the [[Electron spin]]. In order to explain Spin, it is important to remember that **whenever a charged particle moves, it creates a magnetic field**. But, it actually turns out that electrons can only be oriented up or down, and left or right. And that orientation left or right is what gives the "1/2 spin up or down". But **<mark style="background: #F2DDA4;">we don't actually know what spin is.</mark>** There is no concrete definition! And thinking about spinning electrons is just plain wrong. Nothing is moving or rotating. But, scientists thought about spin, and concluded that maybe particles have **Intrinsic [[Angular momentum]]**, meaning they exhibit angular momentum *without actually rotating.*

"Hold up?"

Yeah, it's weird. So, basically, particles spin and don't spin, and angular momentum is an elemental part of this! It is shown that angular momentum precesses when a charged particle moves in a circle, which causes it to stay oriented in one direction. And in a famous experiment, it is shown that 1/2 of the particles are spin-up and the other spin-down (which is probably why 1/2 is in the equation.) 

An interesting question is how come neutrons have spin? It is because of the **charged [[Quarks]]** inside of the neutrons which exert a magnetic field or moment, and that in turn enables spin.

# Binding energy
-------
- the total mass of a stable nucleus is **always** smaller than the individual mass of each proton and neutron. This is very weird! How can this be? The difference in energy is the **binding energy** of the atom. The binding energy is the amount of energy needed to break apart an atom! And since mass and energy are interchangeable, the mass is different. 
![[binding_energy.png]]
From the graph we notice that very heavy elements break apart more easily because they become more and more unstable. 

The binding energy is:
$$E_B = (ZM_H + Nm_n - A/Z M)c^2
$$
Where A/Z M is the mass of the neutral atom containing the nucleus, ZM_H is the mass of the hydrogen atom, and Nm_n is the neutron number times the neutron mass. 


But, how is the nucleus bonded anyway? They are bonded by the [[Strong nuclear force]]. So, the strong nuclear force keeps nuclei together even in the face of the electromagnetic force. But, as atoms grow larger, more and more neutrons are needed to keep the forces in balance and the atom stable.

Eventually, unstable atoms **break down into more stable components.** This process is called [[Radioactive decay]]. 
- ! Nuclei with a ratio below the stability strip dominantly decay via electron capture or beta plus decay. Nuclei with proton number above 83 dominantly decay via [[Alpha decay]]. Nuclei above the stability strip dominantly decay via [[Beta decay]]. 

The difference, as mentioned above, between the mass of the nucleus and the mass of its components added together, can be quantified!
$$âˆ†M = \frac{E_B}{c^2}$$
This is called the **mass defect.** 

- n "*Finally, the nuclear force favors pairing of protons and of neutrons. This energy term is positive (more binding) if both Z and N are even, negative (less binding) if both Z and N are odd, and zero otherwise.*" - University physics
