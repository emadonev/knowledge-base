This is when [[Atoms]] release energy in the form of particles, changing the very nature of the atom in order to become more stable -> this created a radioactive series of elements, each emitting [[Radiation]] in order to become the next element of the sequence until finally reaching a stable element. During this series of decay, [[Isotopes]] are formed, and it was found that some elements have <mark style="background: #A3C4BC;">stable and unstable isotopes.</mark> 

The types of decay are:
- [[Alpha decay]]
- [[Beta decay]]
- [[Gamma decay]]
