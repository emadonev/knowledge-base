The Schr√∂dinger wave equation combines the properties of waves and particles into one formula!
- most matter is a duality of waves and particles
	- light, electrons,...
- solving this equation gave us many **wave functions** for an electron
- the square of the wave functions is the ==probability density== of the electron
	- it tries to predict the probabilty of an electron in a specific location
- because this is a ==probability== and not an actual number, we say that ***electrons orbit in an electron cloud*** rather than having orbits. 
- the solutions to these equations are a set of functions (wave functions) which are called [[Orbitals]]
