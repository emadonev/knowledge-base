> [[Average atomic mass]] => masses of samples

Example of Li:
$$
6.94*(\frac{u}{atom Li}) * number = 6.94g
$$
The number in this equation is Avogadro's number, or 
$$N_A = 6.02214076*10^{23}$$

What is a mole?
Mole is like a container, containing Avogadro's number of atoms. Molar mass is the number of grams the number of atoms (Avogadro's number) make up. 
$$
N =  \frac{m}{M}*N_A
$$
Where, N is the number of atoms, m is the mass of the sample, M is the molar mass, and $N_A$ is Avogadro's number. The molar mass is the [[Average atomic mass]]! 
$$
n =  \frac{m}{M}
$$
Where n is the number of moles.

Basically, here is an illustrated version of every formula:

So, we can package up atoms or [[Formula unit]]s into boxes called **moles.** Every box contains the same number of atoms: **Avogardos constant.** $6.022*10^{23}$ atoms. Now, let's say we have a sample of some [[Atoms]] or formula units, and we don't know how many "things" there are inside. Alas, we have a solution to this problem. We are like detectives trying to solve a mystery. We need to calculate how many atoms or formulas are inside and we have boxes or malls which can tell us how many things are inside. So what we do is in the first formula, we divide the mass of our sample by the mass of one of our boxes. How do I calculate the mass of one of our boxes? We do that by calculating the molar mass and then using that we calculate the number of our tings in the sample.
- ! IMPORTANT: the molar mass is used as a conversion factor between the tiny and the big - between atoms and samples of millions upon millions of atoms.
