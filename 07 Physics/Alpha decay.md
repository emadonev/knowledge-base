This decay occurs when an unstable nucleus releases 2 protons and 2 neutrons. The parent nucleus decays into a child nucleus and an **alpha particle**, being made of $2 p^+$ and $2n^0$. An important note is that the child nucleus and alpha particle together have less mass than the starting nucleus, because some mass gets released **as kinetic energy**. This energy is typically used to generate nuclear power! 

$$\ce{ ^{x+y}_{x}Q -> \ce{ ^{x+y-4}_{x-2}R + ^{4}_{2}\alpha} }$$
