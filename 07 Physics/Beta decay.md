This decay happens when an unstable nucleus releases a **beta particle, or really just an electron.** The main cause of the decay is the instability of the neutron, which is discussed in [[Radiation]]. And coupled with an electron, a [[Neutrino]] is created and released. To compensate for the charge, **a neutron converts into a proton, and emits an electron (beta particle)**. A fundamental part of beta decay is the [[Weak force]]. It can penetrate materials up until thin aluminum.
