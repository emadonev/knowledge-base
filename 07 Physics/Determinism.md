Determinism is when using the laws of nature we are able to predict exactly everything that is about to happen. [[Laplace's demon and determinism]] are very interconnected, determinism being the core of the demon. It relies on knowing [[The TRUE value]], which is virtually impossible due to [[Noise (in observation)]] and [[Uncertainty]]. However, a mathematical system (produced by [[Mathematical models]]) can be deterministic if [[A map (mathy sense)]] does not include a **random number**. Once it contains a random number, it is a [[Stochastic]] system. However, even though determinism is supposed to be fixed, [[Chaos theory]] tells us that chaos is ONLY found in deterministic systems. 

"*Similar states diverge under deterministic dynamics while they converge under linear stochastic dynamics*" from Chaos: a very short introduction. 

Computer models are **always** deterministic. 

In these types of systems, once we define the initial state, the rest of the future for that initial state is predictable and known, and doesn't collide with any other inital state and it's future.

>*"It’s a remarkable discovery. A dynamical system can be completely deterministic, with visible patterns in detailed data, yet a coarse-grained view of the same data can be random – in a provable, rigorous sense. Determinism and randomness are not opposites. In some circumstances, they can be entirely compatible.”*
