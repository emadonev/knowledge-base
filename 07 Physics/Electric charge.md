We have discovered, as far back as Ancient Greece, that **charge** exists. All we knew was that certain objects when rubbed attracted or repelled other objects. Later on, Benjamin Franklin called the 2 separate charges *positive and negative*, and it stuck until today.

This is the cardinal rule of **electrostatics**, the science of observing and modeling the different relations of charged objects. 

#### What is really happening when charging an object?

Now, you might be wondering, "how does this really work? Why does the object suddenly repel another object?" It all comes down to the [[Atoms]] and [[Electron]]s.

We all know that atoms are made up of a [[Nucleus]], which contains [[Protons]] and [[Neutrons]], but the main guys at play here are **electrons.** They have a negative charge, while protons have a positive charge. Atoms can become **ionized** ([[Ionization energy]], [[Ionic bonds]]) if they are **stripped of electrons** (net positive charge) or if **they gained electrons** (net negative charge).

In physics, we constantly transform objects - particles or points in space undergo [[Transformations]]. Since these transformations **shouldn't change anything about an object** - it is ***inherent that certain properties are ==conserved==***. Just as we have conservation of [[Momentum]], or [[Angular momentum]], we have **conservation of charge**:

This means that when we rub to objects together, **the net charge stays the same**, but *some electrons trasnferred from one object to the other*, giving each a slightly different charge.

Finally, what gives the electron charge? Just as with any property, *it is quantized*, hence ==the magnitude of charge of the electron or proton is a natural unit of charge==.

Even though we might all dismiss electric charge and electricity as something niche or something only certain people need - *its actually present everywhere, at least electrostatics.* Electrostatics gives rise to magnetism, electromagnetism, light, how the world works, why we have light, how do [[Stars]] work, how we can stand on the ground with a [[Normal force]], why atoms form [[Atomic bonds]], why we have [[Tension]].
