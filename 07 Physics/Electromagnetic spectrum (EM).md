This encompasses the full spectrum of [[Light]] and all of the different wavelengths and frequencies it can be.

| Region      | Wavelength                  |
| ----------- | --------------------------- |
| Gamma ray   | $\lambda$ < 0.01 nm         |
| X-ray       | 0.01 nm < $\lambda$ < 10 nm |
| Ultraviolet | 10 nm < $\lambda$ < 400 nm  |
| Visible     | 400 nm < $\lambda$ < 700 nm |
| Infrared    | 700 nm < $\lambda$ < 1 mm   |
| Microwave   | 1 mm < $\lambda$ < 10cm     |
| Radio       | 10 cm < $\lambda$           |
