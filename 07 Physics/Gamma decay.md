This decay happens when an unstable nucleus emits a very high energy proton, or **a gamma ray.** Gamma decay usually occurs when the nucleus is excited, meaning it has more energy than in an unexcited state. Since everything in nature wants to have minimal energy, the [[Atoms]] release gamma rays to calm down. There is no change in the composition of the atom, only photons and energy are released. 

$$\ce{ ^{x+y}_{x}Q^* -> \ce{ ^{x+y}_{x}Q + ^{0}_{0}\gamma} }$$

- n The asterisk denotes that the nucleus is *in an excited state*. This means that it has more energy than its minimal state, causing the instability inside the nucleus. That extra energy, when released as a gamma ray, restores the balance in the nucleus.
