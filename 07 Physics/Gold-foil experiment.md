Soon after the discovery of the electron, scientist Ernest Rutherford completed his famous gold foil experiment. He set up a source of alpha particles to shoot them toward a very thin sheet of gold foil. Around the gold foil, a circular fluorescent sheet was placed so the alpha particles would be visible when they hit the screen. When the particles were shot through the gold foil, some **veered off at extreme angles**. This showed that the atoms inside the gold foil **contained positively charged nuclei** (since alpha particles were known to be positively charged). And just like that, the nucleus was discovered.

The alpha particles didn’t all end up directly behind the entry point to the gold foil because of positively charged nuclei in the atoms! We know that alpha particles are positively charged. When interacting with **a positively charged nucleus,** the same charges repel each other. Suppose the alpha particle comes in close enough contact with the nucleus. In that case, the high charge of the nucleus furiously repels the alpha particle, causing it to deflect at very large angles.
