==Heat== is the excess energy that [[Formula unit]]s or [[Atoms]] have other than in their ground state. This energy is represented by their movement such as **vibration, rotation and translation**. When we apply heat to the molecules, atoms, etc. we are forcing them to vibrate, rotate or translate, and thus increasing the ==temperature as well as the heat of the molecules==. 

- n The [[Electron]] has its own magnetic field, and when the electron itself changes, the magnetic field changes, causing even more changes in the atom itself. So, when the **electron moves due to extra heat, the magnetic field also moves, creating ripples in the ==electromagnetic field==**, and thus causing *the release of [[Photons]]!!!* 

In other words:
- eg The change in the energy of an electron always causes a proton.
