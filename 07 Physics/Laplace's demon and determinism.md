According to Newton's laws of motion and mechanics, we should be able to predict the motion of the solar system in a completely [[Determinism]] way. 

Scientist Laplace in 1820 described a **demon, called Laplace's demon**.
>*We may regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its past and the cause of its future. An intellect which at a certain moment would know all forces that set nature in motion, and all positions of all itmes of which nature is compised, if this intellect were also vast enough to submit this data to analysis, it would embrace in a single formula the movements lf the gratest bodies of the universe and those of the tiniest atom; for such an intellect nothing would be uncertain and the future just like the past would be present before its eyes.*

This passage tells us 3 things about the demon(ess?)
1. exact knowledge of how the universe works
2. ability to take a snapshot of the universe
3. infinite computational power

For the demon, chaos is not a problem for predicting the future. 

In the modern world, if we had an agent (basically a demoness), she couldn't predict the future **exactly**, but it would not be a shock for her (she would get the general flow of events), and she could know the probability of any future event. This situation would only work if she had **perfect models to work with.** No perfect models: no way of knowing the probability of future events.
