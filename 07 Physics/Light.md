# Wave nature of light
------
The nature of light is a tad uncertain. Due to the [[Wave-particle duality]], light is both a wave and a particle. Newton said light is made of particles, and Christian Huygens said its made of waves. 

[[Maxwell's Electromagnetic Wave Theory]] is the fundamental component of light, since we define light as an electromagnetic wave. We divide light into the [[Electromagnetic spectrum (EM)]]. A light wave carries [[Energy]] and [[Momentum]], and the rate at which this occurs is called the [[Poynting vector]]. 

One thing which divides different wavelengths of light is *color.* We use [[Spectra]] to look at objects in the universe, where light is differentiated by color. 

# Relationship between frequency, wavelength and energy
-------
==Wavelength== ($\lambda$) is the distance between adjacent peaks of a wave, or the physical distance between 2 oscillations of a wave. It is expressed in $m$. 

==Frequency== ($f$) is the number of events per unit time. In the case of waves, it is the *number of oscillations per unit time.* It is expressed in $Hz$. 

==Energy== ($E$) is a slightly more complicated notion. Light is a wave and a particle, so in the *particle sense*, light is made of **tiny packets of electric and magnetic fields called ==photons==**. But light is also a wave, and the particle-wave duality interchanges constantly, fitting in whichever situation is better. 

A very useful fact about light is that it travels at the same speed everywhere! It is approximately $c = 3 × 10^8 \frac{m}{s}$. Using the fact that, intuitively, less oscillations per unit time means a longer wavelength, wavelength and frequency are *inversely proportional*:$$\lambda = \frac{c}{f}, \; f=\frac{c}{\lambda}, \; \lambda f = c$$
- pr A very intuitive and logical relationship between frequency and energy is that they are proportional. The more oscillations per unit time occur, the more energy was spent enabling those oscillations. This means that since they are proportional, there must be some constant which multiplied by the frequency gives the energy. This constant is called *the planck constant*, and it's one of the most fundamental constants in the universe:$$E = hf, \; h=6.626 × 10^{-34} Js$$

But, what about the relationship between energy and wavelength? Well, we just put the 2 equations together!
$$E = hf = h(\frac{c}{\lambda}) = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$$
# Radiation laws
------
The main type of radiation is [[Blackbody radiation]], where an object absorbs all light but then emits a very predictable spectrum of radiation which depends on the temperature of the object. We use blackbody radiation to determine the energy flux which reaches the Earth:
![[energy flux eart.png]]
- the energy flux received on Earth depends  on the size of the star, it's distance from the earth and the [[Luminosity]] of the star. 

If we were to look at the different blackbody graphs for the emitted flux from the sun for example and look at the received flux on Earth, it might look something like this:
![[recived and emitted flux.png]]

> *"And although the different heights of the five curves makes it somewhat difficult to trace each one, if you look carefully you can see that the curve for blackbody 2 reaches its peak to the right of the peak for blackbody 1. Since wavelength increases to the right in this graph, that means that $λ_{peak}$ for black- body 2 is greater than $λ_{peak}$ for blackbody 1, and Wien’s Law tells you that $λ_{peak}$ is inversely proportional to temperature. Hence blackbody 2 has a lower temperature than blackbody 1. The same analysis applied to the curves for the other blackbodies indicates that blackbody 3 is cooler than blackbody 2, blackbody 4 has even lower temperature, and blackbody 5 is the coolest of the lot. So if blackbody 3 has lower temperature than blackbodies 1 and 2, why is its curve higher? One possible reason is that blackbody 3 is bigger than the others – if it has more surface area, then the total power it radiates into space is greater, even though it gives off fewer watts per square meter. Another possible reason is that blackbody 3 may be closer than the others, and since these are graphs of received energy flux, the height of the curve depends on the distance to the object."* - A student's guide to the mathematics of astronomy


# Doppler shift
------
An extremely important aspect of light is [[The Doppler effect]] or shift.

# Spectra
---
We can observe light from distant stars using [[Spectra]]. But, how do we split light into spectra? We can pass it through a prism or a [[Diffraction grating]]:

# Behaviour
---
Light can behave in different ways, when characterized as a wave: [[Wave behaviour of light]]. Light can also scatter ([[Scattering of light]]).
