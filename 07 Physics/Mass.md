### Classic
Mass is an intrinsic property of matter. If we isolate our object, mass will always be present! In the classical physics sense, mass is defined
- eg as an object's resistance to [[Inertia]], or the acceleration due to a force acting on the object.
- eg as a property which gives rise to [[The universal law of gravitation]]. 

### Relativity
However, in the relativistic sense, mass is something slightly different.
- pr Mass is defined as: $$E=mc^2$$, which shows that *mass and energy are interchangeable*, which gives rise to [[Nuclear physics]]. 
	- and because of this equation, we cannot travel infinitely fast, because the faster we approach the speed of [[Light]], our relative mass increases, which would require infinite energy! 

### Quantum physics
Here is where things get complicated, and we introduce the [[Higgs boson and higgs field video]] as well as the [[Higgs boson]] and the [[Higgs field]].
