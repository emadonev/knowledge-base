A Scottish scientist James Clerk Maxwell condensed everything we know about electric and magnetic fields into his famous 4 Maxwell equations. He could manipulate his equations to produce wave equations for electric and magnetic vectors E and B. They predicted the existence of *electromagnetic waves*, and it was later discovered that they were light!

The speed of these waves is the same as [[The speed of light]]! We can equate the speed via this formula:
$$v = \frac{1}{\sqrt{âˆˆ_0\mu_0}}$$
Where the denominator contains the fundamental constants of electric and magnetic fields. He discovered that light was an electromagnetic **transverse** wave. This meant that the electric and magnetic waves are perpendicular to each other.

He didn't however discover light waves in real life. The discovery came after his death by Heinrich Hertz who produced radio waves in his lab. He confirmed the speed of light, and its reflection, refraction and polarisation properties.
