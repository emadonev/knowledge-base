The notion of motion is difficult for physicists since how do you explain the ==change from being stationary to moving instantaneously==? 

What we can say is that **force** definitely creates motion. By applying a force an object undergoes acceleration, and hence motion. The longer we act on an object with a force, the faster it is going to go. We can define **Impulse (I)** as: $$I = Ft$$, where F is force and t is time. Now, we can substitute F with our classical Newton's second law of motion, F = ma:$$I = mat$$, and knowing that [[Acceleration]] and [[Time]] together give [[Velocity]], our final equation $$p = mv$$, where p is the change in momentum, so impulse actually means a *change in momentum.* Using this quantity, we can define the motion of an object.
