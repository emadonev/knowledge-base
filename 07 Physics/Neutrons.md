This subatomic particle is found in the nucleus, and it is used as a buffer between [[Protons]] and [[Electron]]s. They are neutral, meaning they have no charge. They are made of 2 down [[Quarks]] and one up quark. And they are unstable in the long term!
When neutrons find themselves in the nuclei of [[Atoms]], they are stable because the gluons keep the quarks in the same flavor.[[Gluons]] are massless particles and carriers of the [[Strong nuclear force]]. They keep protons and neutrons tightly bound. However, nothing retains the quarks from changing flavors if a neutron is isolated!

So, one of the down quarks in a neutron turns into an up quark, mediated by a [[Boson]]. This particle mediates the [[Weak force]] responsible for quark behavior. This boson is quite unstable and quickly decays into an electron and an antineutrino ([[Neutrino]]). The neutron transforms into a proton with the electron and the antineutrino released.
