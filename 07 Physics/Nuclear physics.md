This branch of physics is based primarily on Einstein's equation 
$$E = mc^2$$
which tells us that energy can be converted to matter and the opposite is also true. It looks into the nucleus of  [[Atoms]], discusses the [[Properties of nuclei]], and 2 new forces: [[Transmutation]] and [[Radioactive decay]]. A few basic facts about the nucleus:
- it contains [[Protons]] and [[Neutrons]]. These two are collectively called **Nucleons.** 

An important part of nuclear physics is the study of [[Isotopes]] and their respective [[Average atomic mass]]es.
