Neils Bohr came in in 1913 with his **planetary model** of the atom. He proposed that electrons orbit the nucleus in shells. Each shell is in a specific layer around the nucleus and can contain electrons of certain energy levels and different spins. The further away the electron is from the nucleus, the more energy it has, and vice versa. While this model was very successful then, the more we learned about the atom and mainly electrons, the more inconsistencies were found, which had to be fixed.
