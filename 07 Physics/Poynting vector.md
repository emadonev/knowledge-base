This vector tells us the rate at which energy and momentum is carried by [[Light]] waves according to [[Maxwell's Electromagnetic Wave Theory]]. In other words, 
> *it tells you the direction in which energy is flowing and how much energy is flowing in that direction. - ChatGPT*

 It is described as:
$$S = \frac{1}{\mu_0}E Ã— B$$
The direction of this vector is in the direction of the wave's propagation, and it's magnitude is equal to the magnitude of energy per time which crosses an area perpendicular to the direction of the propagation. 

Since E and B vary harmonically with time, we like to calculate the time-averaged value of the Poynting vector in a vacuum, calculated as such:
$$<S> = \frac{1}{2\mu_0}E_0B_0$$
Where $E_0$ and $B_0$ are the maximum magnitudes of the electric and magnetic fields. This equation describes the radiant flux in terms of the electric and magnetic fields (however, this type is restricted to certain wavelengths.) ([[Photometric quantities]])

Since the wave carries momentum, it exerts pressure or force on the object it is hitting. When the waves of light or photons (due to the [[Wave-particle duality]]) hit the surface with momentum, we have a colission and the momentum is transferred. When the momentum is summed up, it creates a measurable force! This is called **radiation pressure**, and it depends on the fact wether light was *reflected* or *absorbed*.

- pr **Force if light is absorbed**: $$F_{rad} = \frac{<S>A}{c}cos\theta$$, where $<S>$ is the time-averaged Poynting vector, $A$ is the surface area, $c$ is the speed of light, and $cos\theta$ is the cosine of the angle of incidence. 
- pr **Force if light is reflected:** $$F_{rad} = \frac{2<S>A}{c}cos^2\theta$$, where $<S>$ is the time-averaged Poynting vector, $A$ is the surface area, $c$ is the speed of light, and $cos^2\theta$ is the cosine squared of the angle of incidence. 

- eg *When light is reflected, it imparts twice the momentum compared to when it's absorbed (because the direction of the momentum of the photons is reversed upon reflection). If they're reflected, they essentially "bounce back," reversing their momentum direction, which effectively doubles the momentum transfer.* - ChatGPT
