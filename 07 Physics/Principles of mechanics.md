Let's think about motion in nature. There are 4 basic principles of moving bodies, established by Galileo and Newton back in the day.

#### Law zero
> The laws of physics are the same in all *inertial reference systems* - systems moving at a constant velocity with respect to one another.

The first law takes into account reference frames, which are basically different ways of looking at the same situation. If you are watching cars from the side of the road, they are moving *relative to you*, since you are stationery. If you are in a car and driving, and there is another car exactly next to you driving at the same [[Velocity]], you *don't appear to be moving* (we are ignoring the background of course), the other car is **stationary**, relative to you. 

The first law is saying that the laws of physics should stay the same no matter in which inertial reference frame you are. 

#### 1st law of motion
> In an inertial reference system, every object in a state of uniform motion remains in that state of motion unless acted upon by an external force.

This law basically describes **inertia**, or the body's tendency to stay in motion/rest unless acted upon by another force.

#### 2nd law of motion
> The resultant force acting on a body is equal to its mass times its acceleration $$\vec{F} = m\vec{a}$$

The infamous F=ma, where force is proportional to acceleration by the mass of the object. The little arrows mean that force and acceleration are **vector quantities**.

Momentum is a quantity in physics used to describe moving bodies, sort of like a quality of inertia. It is a vector quantity:
- f $$\vec{p} = m\vec{v}$$

It is responsible for rest and for movement, since no momentum means no movement, and it is **always conserved.** Now, we define **FORCE** as a *change in momentum over time*, which we can describe with derivatives:$$F = \frac{dp}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}(mv)$$, where we can replace p with the $m\vec{v}$ quantity (here we don't use vector signs since the direction is already calculated in). 

Mass is a constant, so we can move it **out of the derivative**, since it doesn't change over time, with which we get:$$F = m\frac{dv}{dt}$$, and what is the change in velocity over time? Acceleration!
- f $$F = ma$$

And that is how we arrive at Newton's second law.

#### Third law of motion

> If A exerts a force $\vec{F}$ on B, then B exerts a force $-\vec{F}$ on A with the same magnitude but opposite direction.

This is commonly known as the law of equal and opposite reaction. It really states that everything interacts with everything.
