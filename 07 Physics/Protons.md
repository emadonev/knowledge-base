**Protons** are made of 3 quarks and are found in the [[Nucleus]] of the [[Atoms]]: 2 up quarks and one down quark, tightly bound together by **gluons** _(more about them later)_. Quarks are indivisible particles with a slight charge and come in different flavors! They can be _up, down, charm, strange, top and bottom_. And even though the names sound weird, the only differences between these types are the [[Mass]] and charge. Only up and down quarks are found in ordinary matter. In contrast, the rest of the quarks are produced in very high-energy collisions and last a very short time. Since they are so small, it is hard to conduct research with them, which is ongoing.

As of our current understanding, protons are either very stable particles or have an extremely long half-life.

Why are protons positively charged (+1)? Because it has 2 up [[Quarks]] with charge +2/3 and one down quark with charge -1/3, which added together is: 4/3 - 1/3 = 3/3 = +1!!
However, the spin of the proton is worrying! Scientists couldn't find the cause for the proton spin, because quarks didn't contribute enough! In later data, it was revealed that [[Gluons]] could contribute up to 50%, but things were messy.
