Everything in nature has **intrinsic properties** and **extrinsic properties**.
- eg Intrinsic properties are ones which are intrinsically part of the particle. If it was the last thing in the universe, it would still exhibit these properties. Examples are: [[Mass]], charge and, well, spin! 
- eg Extrinsic properties are properties which are defined by what the particle is doing, its motion and its position in both space and time. 

**SPIN** is an intrinsic property of particles. It has [[Angular momentum]] without actually rotating? How the heck is this possible? Introducing: the Stern-Gerlach experiment.

### Stern-Gerlach experiment

This is the experiment setup. So, particles are shot through a space between 2 magnets with north and south poles. Because of the shape of the south pole magnet, it is stronger than the north pole magnet, so the magnetic field isn't structured, rather a tad irregular. 
- pr If an [[Electron]] was actually spinning, then it would have to rotate at a speed millions of times faster than the speed of light, which is **impossible.** Thus, electrons don't actually rotate. 

If we were to fling bar magnets through the apparatus, we would have 3 possible beginning positions of the magnet: up, down, and at an angle. However, the general idea was that the detector would see a distribution of positions based on the speed of each bar magnet (those at an angle) so they could turn around properly. But this wasn't the case with electrons! Why?

So, basically, electrons exhibit intrinsic angular momentum, but they don't rotate because they can't, so they **precess**. Precession in this case is the rotation of the angular momentum vector which traces a circular path due to [[Torque]]. So, the vector of angular momentum can only be oriented **up or down, hence spin-up and spin-down.**
