**Radiation** is when an atom releases energy in the form of particles which are radioactive. This process stabilizes the atom, especially large [[Atoms]]

# Discovery of radiation
-------
Radiation was discovered by <mark style="background: #A3C4BC;">Henry Becquerel</mark> shortly after the discovery of X-rays (a type of [[Light]] of the [[Electromagnetic spectrum (EM)]]), due to his curiosity to discover more about them. 

- ex He conducted the following experiment: He used $K_2UO_2(SO_4)_2$, which contained **uranium**, as you can see in the formula. He left the compound in a small tray and in front of it put a piece of black paper. After some time, he noticed that the compound left marks on the sheet of paper and they were quite visible. He didn't know why or how it worked, but we nowadays now that this is a type of [[Radioactive decay]]. This term was coined by <mark style="background: #A3C4BC;">Marie Curie</mark>, who discovered **radium and polonium.** 

# Types of radioactivity
------
There are known to be several types of radioactive decay. They are [[Alpha decay]], [[Beta decay]] and [[Gamma decay]]. Each has different strength levels and types of particles which they emit. Every radioactive particle has something called a [[Half-life]]. 

# Stability of particles
-------
The atom is composed of the [[Nucleus]] and the **electron cloud.** Our nucleus contains [[Protons]] and [[Neutrons]], while the cloud contains [[Electron]]s. They, even though outside of the nucleus, play a crucial role in the particle emission of decaying elements. 

An important note which is relevant to [[Properties of nuclei]], is that:
- !! **Protons and electrons** are *stable*. This means that no matter how much time passes, they will never change or decay into another particle
- !! **Neutrons** are *unstable*. This means that after a certain amount of time, they will decay into other particles. $n^0 â†’ p^+ + e^-$

Another interesting property considering the stability of nuclei, is that elements up until proton number 83 aren't radioactive. This means that heavier elements than that are unstable enough to undergo radioactive decay.

During radioactive decay sequences, it is important to look at [[Group displacement laws]]. They state the different types of atoms depending on their composition.
