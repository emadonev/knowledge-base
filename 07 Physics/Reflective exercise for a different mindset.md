## Step 2: Consider
#### Considering my feelings last year
I am feeling anxious -> I'm feeling scared of...
-> the fear roots of anxiety

stressed -> I am feeling scared of: not being able to learn enough in time, of not doing everything I should be doing, of not being good enough to get into college, of not having good grades.

overwhelmed -> I am feeling scared of: failing my projects, of taking up too many projects which will inevitably lead to my doom, not doing things well enough, not impressing anyone, of passing as average with my work.

insecure -> I am feeling scared of: not always looking my best and then people won't like me so much, exposing my skin and people seeing I am not perfect and then they will think less of me, saying the wrong things, thinking differently from other people and then they won't want to spend time with me

self-conscious -> I am feeling scared of: rejection, people not liking me, not having any friends, not getting into a relationship, not having somebody who understands me

- I cannot be close to anyone, I fear closeness because I am scared that they will leave once they see me for the "real" me and they don't want to deal with me anymore 

### Considering my experiences last year
**Objectively bad but feels familiar**
- obsessing sometimes over my grades
- overworking myself with projects
- constantly trying to work and study something
- constantly feeling guilty and then not enjoying anything fun 
- not protesting if i think that other people's opinions are wrong so I don't fight with them
- people telling me how i feel but never asking me or not believing me when I say the truth

**Objectively good but feel uncomfortable/unfamiliar**
- meeting with people I do not sit with or spend a lot of time with
- going on trips with other people
- getting invited to "fun" parties and events

Do I fell that I deserve the love and the peace that I need to be happy?
- Yes and no. I really want to have love and peace and be happy, but sometimes I just hate myself and think I don't need it or don't deserve it.

How and why do I deny myself positive experiences?
- Sometimes (as of the last 4-5 months, but not the past week or so) I feel like I can never enjoy anything, things don't make me smile anymore, all of the happiness feelings feel hollow somehow and I deny myself fun things and having fun because I just tell myself its not fun period. I have a hard time enjoying time with friends with whom I am not very close with, etc. I deny myself reading books and watching shows because I tell myself its a waste of time and I don't deserve it because I didn't work hard enough, and I never work hard enough in a day. I don't let myself enjoy life too much because I fear I will never want to go back to work again.

### Considering my preoccupations
**What good has ever come out of my ruminations?**
- I have started focusing more on my projects and learning things -> but I stress a lot about that

## Correct!
PEOPLE
- lots of people who trigger negative emotions are popular people (but I don't hang out with them), Masa(I barely talk to her) and my parents. 
	- I love my parents, and have never been good at communicating for the fear of being judged and misunderstood. So next time I'm not feeling well based on somebody's comment, I will attempt this:
		- I'm feeling this way, but it doesn't mean things are this way
		- Is this what this person actually said/did or am I interpreting it based on something else
		- Genuinely vulnerably communicate: no matter what they say. I won't defend myself and i won't try to attack them. I will try to make them understand.
WORK/STUDY
- grounding myself to reality bc I do study a lot and I want to study! 

Why do I want to change?
- because I want to wake up in the morning with a smile on my face. I want to go through a day where at the end of it I am actually proud of myself and don't feel guilty. I want to go through a day where I enjoy life for a change. 

**Phrases I want to use more next year**
- I am actually really tired and can't study anymore.
- I feel overwhelmed, give me a minute.
- I want to cry, it helps me be free.
- I love learning, not doing it sometimes is fine.
- Just bc I am not doing something 24/7 doesn't mean I don't love it.
- I just want to have some alone-time.
- Being anxious and stressed is okay, I will get better.
- Me talking about something is not dramatizing.
