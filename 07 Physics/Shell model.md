This model says the nucleus is like the electron cloud: it contains shells of differing energy levels where protons and neutrons can be with different spins, based on the **Pauli exclusion principle**. This principle states that no two particles can be in the same state in the same space (orbital or shell). So, in each shell of our nucleus, protons and neutrons cannot be in the same state, meaning they can’t have the same **spin**.How does this work?

As scientists observed many, many different isotopes of elements, they noticed something very curious. If nuclei had even numbers of both protons and neutrons, they would be much more stable than even-odd, odd-even, and especially odd-odd combinations. A possible reason for this even-even preference might be because the strong force prefers pairs of neutrons and protons! This means that they are bonded tighter and, hence, more stable.

So, this means the nucleus has some structure, doesn’t it? If things are this ordered? A Polish-American scientist, Maria Goeppert-Mayer, created the **shell model**, which says that the nucleus is composed and contains shells where nucleons reside. Sometimes, isotopes are exceptionally stable or common if they have the following **magic numbers of nucleons in the nucleus:** 2, 8, 20, 50, 82, and 126.
