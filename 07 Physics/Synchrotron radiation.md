This form of radiation occurs during [[Supernova]] explosions as high mass stars enter [[Stellar old age]] and die.

It usually occurs in areas with **strong magnetic fields**, and with the presence of lots of [[Electron]]s. A magnetic field has **field lines**, which tell us how strong it is at certain points. The [[Vectors]] of  the electron's [[Velocity]] stay aligned with the fields, since the force is perpendicular to the field direction, and hence the velocity. This makes the electron experience circular motion as it drifts along its path, making it accelerate - therefore **it must give off radiation.** Or, more simply, an electron is forced to follow a curved path due to the magnetic field and is accelerated to very high speeds due to 1) circular motion and 2) the high energy of the explosion.

It is super strong radiation and spans over the entire [[Electromagnetic spectrum (EM)]].
