When we measure things, we can never know for certain the **true** length of a table, we always have some [[Uncertainty]]. [[Noise (in observation)]] is the cause of [[Uncertainty]]. Small uncertainties can become large and therefore interfere with our model. 

==QUESTION: What is really the **true value**? Does it **really** exist?==

Many scientists are giving up on the notion of a True value, because we never seem to reach it. Currently we are working on ways to measure the distance from the true value (measuring [[Uncertainty]]).
