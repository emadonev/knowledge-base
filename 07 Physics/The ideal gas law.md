- **Boyles law**: if we decrease the volume of a gas, its pressure increases ad vice versa. The formula is $pV = k$, where k is some constant if the mass and temperature of the gas stay the same
- **Jacques Charles** discovered another law: if we divide the volume by the temperature, the value is always the same, some constant b.
- **Avogadro** discovered that dividing the volume by the number of moles in a substance is also a constant value!
- All of these combined together give the **ideal gas law:** $$pV = nRT$$
    - R is the universal gas constant, or 8.314 J/K mol

    - pr so all of these factors of a gas are interconnected: the pressure is the pressure exerted by the movement of particles bumping into each other or the surface of the container they are in, volume is the amount of space those particles assume, and the more space there is, the less violently is the crashing and vice versa. The more moles there are, the more particles there are, and everything becomes larger, like the volume and pressure. Finally, temperature is the kinetic energy of the particles inside the container, and the more particles there are, or if the pressure is higher then the temperature also increases.
