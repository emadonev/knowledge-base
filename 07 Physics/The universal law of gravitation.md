Newton thought about the Moon and apples, and he came up with a universal law of gravitation which is used extremely often in celestial mechanics because, well, everything is affected by gravity or well the gravitational field produced by every object with mass. 

- f $$F_g = G\frac{Mm}{r^2}$$

And with this law, he makes 2 extremely important assumptions (which can be proven, but its too complex for now):
1. The gravitational field created outside a spherically symmetric body is the same as if it were a point mass of the same mass placed at the centre. 
2. We can consider a surface such that only the mass inside it contributes to the gravitational field, while mass outside gives a net zero contribution. 

The first point allows us to say that the gravitational impact of a planet or star or rocket (a bit of a stretch but it still works) can be placed at its **centre of mass**. 

We can measure the strength of a gravitational field with the **gravitational acceleration**, where we coincide the weight of an object (the effect of the field) with the universal law:$$mg = G\frac{Mm}{r^2}$$
- f $$g = G\frac{M}{r^2}$$, and for Earth its value is 9.81 m/s2
