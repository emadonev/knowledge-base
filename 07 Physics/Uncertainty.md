Uncertainty is the difference of a measured quantity from [[The TRUE value]]. Understanding uncertainty can help us understand [[Chaos theory]]. 

>No measurement is good without knowing our uncertainty.

- very useful (and important) to estimate the uncertainty of our forecast, and scientists usually make sure that the inital uncertainty is **infinitesimally small**
- we can never be extremely off (gruba pogreska), like 100ÂºC off, or 3 meters off our measurement of a table
