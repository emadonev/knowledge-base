So, uniform circular motion is when objects move in a circular path around the centre of the circle. They don't change in their [[Velocity]], but their [[Position]] and [[Time]] change constantly, as well as the **direction**, causing [[Acceleration]]. How does this look like?

When an object is moving in a circular path, the velocity is **perpendicular** to the circular path, or it is the circle's [[Tangent]]. Why? Because of [[Inertia]], objects don't want to change their paths and they want to continue moving straight, unless **another force acts upon the object, turning it.** So, this force is called the **CENTRIPETAL FORCE.** This force isn't exactly real, like there isn't a force in nature with a specific equation called the centripetal force, but we exchange it with a proper force acting on the body like ([[The universal law of gravitation]], [[Friction]], [[Tension]],...) 
$$v = \frac{2Ï€r}{T}$$
$$a = \frac{v^2}{r}$$

- ! In order to derive the equation above, [[Derivative]]s are needed which we don't know yet!
