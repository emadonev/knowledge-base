[[Light]] has different ways of behaving depending on the matter it is interacting with: 
![[wave behviour light.png]]
So, light can be:
1. ==Absorbed==: all the energy is absorbed into the component atoms
2. ==Emitted==: energy is released from atoms
3. ==Transmitted==: light just passes through the material
4. ==Reflected==: light bounces of the material at the same angle it came in with
5. ==Refracted==: light changes its direction as it goes through a material
