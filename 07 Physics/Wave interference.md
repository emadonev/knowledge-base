[[Light]] is known to exhibit the [[Wave-particle duality]], and a famous property is **wave interference.** This happens when the crests and throughs of waves align with one another to produce interference, or the addition or cancelation of certain waves.

We have now a new pattern of minima and maxima, which are useful for [[Telescopes]], as these interferences are important for viewing objects in space and their 'airy disks'.

The bright area in the photo is what the telescope sees, and so the image is brighter than the background with wave interference.
