This duality states that something (like [[Light]]) is both a wave and a particle at the same time! 

## Young's double slit experiment
-----
- ex In this experiment, a monochromatic wave of light with a wavelength of $\lambda$ passes through 2 narrow, parallel slits which are separated by $d$. So, as light passes through the slits, the result on the other side are *interference fringes*, or alternating dark and light spots which can only be explained by **waves.** Waves add algebraically, so if the crests and throughs match, they are added, and if they don't match they are subtracted. So, we have *constructive and destructive interference*. 

The path difference between 2 rays of light is equal to the following equation based on the geometric setup:

$$y = d*sin (\theta)$$
In order for us to calculate if a particular wavelength will give us dark or light fringes, the path difference needs to be a whole number for constructive interference and a not whole number for the destructive interference. 
$$d*sin (\theta) = m\lambda  \;(m = 0, 1, 2, ...)$$
$\ce{->}$ constructive interference
$$d*sin (\theta) = (m-\frac{1}{2})\lambda  \;(m = 1, 2, 3, ...)$$
$\ce{->}$ destructive interference

Why is this true? *Because a full wavelength (or any whole number multiple of it) brings the wave back to the same phase position.* - ChatGPT
