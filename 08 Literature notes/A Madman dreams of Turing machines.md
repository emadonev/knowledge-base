This book was simply amazing. It was a gorgeous retelling of the lives of Alan Turing and Kurt Gödel, with their delusions, hallucinations and ultimately, their tragic deaths. They say all great mathematicians kill themselves. This book is the proof for that statement. I love how her writing is unhinged, not standard and simply unique. She states that she is a liar trying to state the truth. How it doesn’t matter when a story begins because any time or place is as good as any. She doesn’t search for the perfect moment or the perfect timing to write something: she just does. And it brings beauty into the book, with moments in their lives overlapping, time twisting and not being chronological. Many philosophies and truly mysterious questions were posed in this book, and the sentences use tons of metaphors and beautiful words to depict what happened and how the people were feeling. It felt so personal and so real, like I was really the third point of a triangle, looking into their life.

1.  Alan Turing was gay and a highly functioning autistic person, and his first crush in high school/boarding school was Chris. They were good friends, never together, but Chris protected Alan and Alan loved Chris. Unfortunately, Chris died of tuberculosis at a very young age (speculating 16) and Alan grieved quite a bit
2.  At this time, Alan stopped believing in God, because where is God in 1+1 = 2? He thought the universe was deterministic, and even though his choices seemed like he was making them he knew this was how it was supposed to be and he had no say in it.
3.  He tried to follow the footsteps of Chris, bc Chris was super smart and he had lots of scholarships and he was going to attend Trinity College. However, Turing was not that good and got into Kings College, and tried to make a mark on the world.
4.  He got a job as a cryptoanalyst for cracking the enigma code, and he used the idea that there was always a bit of text at the beginning of each transcription to which they knew the meaning, so he could wither away the many many possibilites and leave only the ones which can be checked by hand. From this came the idea for the Turing machine, as he was lying the the grassy fields on Cambridge campus.
5.  He was engaged to Joane, his best friend when he was in the cryptoanalyst business, however they called off the marriage. Later in life, he got arrested for Gross Indecency, and he had to do castration using estrogen which ruined him. It is said he killed himself using an apple and his own electrolyte experiment.
6.  Kurt Gödel was a very accomplished mathematician, since he discovered the incompleteness theorems. He believed that mathematics was on a different reality from the rest of the universe, and that in that reality there was no war, no opinions just numbers. He didnt know what was real and what was not, but he knew that numbers were real.
7.  He thought that his contribution to the world was meaningless because lots of people ridiculed him and did not really find purpose in the theorem. He also thought that the world had some natural order but that he had free will and he could choose to adhere the order
8.  He was married to Adele, who always cooked and cleaned and took care of him. However him being paranoid made him believe that she tried to kill him and yet he still loved her.
9.  He was part of the Circle, a group of mathematicians who would discuss philosophy and problems, and this is where he first posed the idea for the incompleteness theorems. Later he went to Princeton, but after just 2 months he broke down and had to return to Europe and recover in a mental health hospital. He returned once more with his new wife Adele by his side. His best friend was Einstein, but not a lot was said in the book
10.  At the end of his life, Adele got sick and had to do surgery for her thick intestine and he was left on his own and his decline began. He stopped eating, until he only had 30 kg. Oskar, his good colleague told him to go to a hospital, but it was too late. he wanted to kill himself, and he did not want to eat because that was the natural order of things and he wanted to go against them. He always thought everybody was out to kill him and poison him so he didnt want to eat ahything too.
