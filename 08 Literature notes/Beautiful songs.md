For there is a beginning 
Marked by a cry and a breath. 
Strange how we already know 
This beginning is truly an end. 

There is no escaping 
The fate that we all share. 
One day, we will shed our last tears 
And breathe our last breath. 

But for now, enjoy life. 
Find pleasure in its touch. 

Cling to the unknown Mother 
Whose womb we've all shared. 

As long as we're here 
Death will flirt with us all. 
Waiting to close our eyes 
And rob us of this life. 

On that last given day 
We will be as we once were â€“ 
Crying and gasping ... 
Greedy for the breath 
We knew we would one day lose. 

But who knows, 
Maybe this end 
Is not at all what it seems. 
Maybe this end is a true beginning.

## Lost in space as an astronaut
Lost in space and time, I roam 
An astronaut adrift, so far from home 
My ship, my beacon, lost from sight 
I wander in the endless night 

But as I gaze upon the stars 
And see the galaxies from afar 
I'm mesmerised, in awe, entranced 
By beauty that leaves me in a trance 

The nebulae, like clouds of dreams 
The supernovae, like fiery beams 
The planets, spinning in their dance 
All of it, a cosmic romance 

I've forgotten why I came this way 
To reach my ship, to end my stay 
But now I wish to stay and see 
The wonders that infinity holds for me 

But as I stand here, lost in thought 
I know my time is dearly bought 
I must return, my mission clear 
But I'll forever hold this wonder dear 

So as I journey back to base 
I'll carry with me memories to grace 
The beauty I've seen, the peace I've found 
Will stay with me, my feet back on solid ground.
