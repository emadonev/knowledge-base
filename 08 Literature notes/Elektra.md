My most recent book report for school was Antigone, by Sophocles. A tragic play about the injustice of Antigone who suffered death because of Creon's rule barring her from burrying her brother. Because of this, I decided to delve into some of the greek retellings I have on my shelves, one of them being Elektra by Jennifer Saint. Elektra is also a tragedy, about the daughter of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra, the rulers of Mycenae. I was not prepared for the emotional ride this book would cause.

The book wove a tale of three women, often hidden in the background of the Trojan war. They were Cassandra, a Trojan princess and foreseer of future. However, nobody believed what she said the future would hold, as was Apolo's curse. Clymenestra, Queen of Mycenae, sister of Helena, the most beautiful woman in the world. Finally, we have Elektra, the daughter of Clymenestra and Agamemnon. Even if you knew the ending to this tale, which I did not, this book will give you a very close connection to the characters and their thoughts which perhaps just a myth cannot convey. 

The writing was beautiful, brimming with thought and emotion. The characters were beautifully portrayed, their thoughts alarmingly clear and well articulated, their actions described so well I could imagine myself being there and experiencing everything. 

I truly loved this book, and I think it is a gorgeous retelling of the tale of Elektra. While it didn't make me cry as much as the Song of Achilles from Madeline Miller, this book is a gem you should definitely read.

## ANALYSIS
### Cassandra
Cassandra is the foreseer of the future, the princess of Troy. However, she was not always like this. At a young age, she was shy and a bit different from the rest of her siblings. She was not chatty and willing for marriage. And so, she decided to become a priestess of Apolo. While she thought being a priestess would grant her solitude and the opportunity to fit in somewhere in the city, Apolo appears before her and grants her the gift of prophecy. But no gift comes without a price. He wanted to make love to her, but she did not and refused his proposal. Angered, he lashed out and cursed her to have visions but for nobody to believe her. And thus begins the torment of Cassandra, the prophet which everybody deems mad and crazy. She tries to live a normal life, however head splitting visions swarm her, rocking her off of her world and reality. She feels incredibly lonely, not having ayone to cling to, nobody who would believe her. She knew how the Trojan war would end. How it would end. And yet, nobody listened. She was enslaved in the end, and Agamemnon took her as his prize. Along with the torment of Apolo, now she was tormented by Agamemnon. She finally arrived at the palace doors of Mycenae, knowing that Agamemnon would die. His death brought her comfort, knowing he can never touch her again. She is so tired. Tired of having to take in Apolo's suffering without complaint for years on end. She just wants it to be over. She asks Clymenestra to kill her, to let her go to the Underworld where she can find peace. And so she does. Finally freeing herself from the wrath of Apolo, for disobeing the wants of greedy and selfish men. She was tormented by everyone she loved and cherished, people and gods she did not know powers of, and she never turned on herself. Never did she harm anybody else. Never did she want revenge. All she wanted is for it to end. This endurance shows her strength and resilience to fall off of her principles and towards a path of endless rage and revenge, which would never cease the fire in her soul. 

### Clymenestra
Mighty Queen of Mycenae. Traumatized by her daughters death. She had 3 daughters at the time. Agamemnon promised Iphigenia's hand to Achilles, and they were to be married at Aulis. Clymenetra was thrilled her daughter is going to marry such a spoken for man, but feared for her daughter, that she was too young, that she would belong to someone else other than her. Arriving there, seeing her daughter proceeding forward, made her feel proud. And then, someone grabbed her. Agamemnon grabbed his daughter, took a knife and slit her throat. Iphigenia slumped down to the ground, blood forming rivers from her body. Clymenestra, breaking, shattering from the inside out. She was dead, hollow from the inside. She forgot about all of her other children, having no emotion or love for them. She was so engufled by her grief she couldn't be herself anymore. All she ever, ever wanted was to murder Agamemnon. To avenge her daughter. So she could sleep at night. She fell for Agamemnon's cousin, who became the king of Mycenae in Agamemnons absence. She plotted the murder for 10 years. Festering the anger and fury. Relishing in the thought of his death. When his body would be a piece of meat. She was so enrapt with the thought of his death, she did not care for her daughters or son. She forgot about the rest of her life, ruining their lives forever, making them murder her. It was troubling to read her gruesome thoughts, the things she took pleasure in. It felt wrong for a person to have such thoughts. She felt free after killing him. She could sleep at night, knowing it was her who killed him. 

### Elektra
The broken daughter of Clymenestra. The daughter who hasn't seen her father since the age of 4-6. Ten years she waited, and waited. And then her mother murdered him. Took away the only chance of her to see him again. She was furious. Enraged. She waited. Another ten years she waited, plotting the murder of her mother and lover. Waiting for her brother to grow up. Being married to her best friend and never giving him any kindness or love because she was so engulfed in grief and love for her father. Obsessed. She couldn't talk about anything else or think aobut anything else for 2 decades. She compares all men to her father. She thinks about him every day, every night. Waiting for him to come home. Hating her mother with reason and lover for no apparent reason. Envying anybody, even Cassandra, who was abused by Agamemnon, who touched him, listening to him, was next to him while she was not. Reading her broken and angered thoughts was disturbing, to say the least. It was so well captured, her rage, her emotion, her lack of care for anyone else really. It was horrifying to see a soft and wonderful daughter turn into a monster who urges her brother to kill her mother. Everything for her father. She thought he did a noble thing, killing her own blood, her sister. Because the gods asked for it. Like it justified everything. She would have sacrificed herself for him. She would have died, for him. Elektra was broken from the inside like her mother after Iphigenia died. But not because of Iphigenia. 

This book portrayes revenge, anger and the lust for murder and bloodshed better than any book I have read so far. It weaves a tapestry of emotion, plots, plans, interactions and thoughts which destroy people, kill them and haunt them in the Underworld. It shows how different sides of the story see the same thing differently. How Clymenestra hated Agamemnon while Elektra was enamored by him. It was an amazing retelling of a tragedy we can proudly call Greek.

### Quotes

“I stayed silent. I realised that when I had seen all those suitors clamour in the hall for Helen, I had believed they were there because they loved her, but I had been wrong. They hated her. They hated her because she was so beautiful and because she made them want her so much. Nothing brought them more joy than the fall of a lovely woman. They picked over her reputation like vultures, scavenging for every scrap of flesh they could devour.”

“Let him come back so that I can see his eyes as the light drains from them. Let him come back and die at the hands of his bitterest enemy. Let him come back so that I can watch him suffer. And let me make it slow.”
