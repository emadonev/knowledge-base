#### How to start writing

> Every intellectual endeavour starts with a note.

- We never start with a blank page: we need to organise our notes so that they do the hard work for us, and all we have to do is collect the thoughts into one cohesive whole
- The most important aspects are self-discipline and self-control, willpower won't get you far, especially because work should be done because *we want to get it done*
- planning is horrible, because we impose a certain structure on ourselves and we deny us the freedom of thinking and creating freely
- this does not mean that we should not have structure: organisation and planning are not the same thing. Nobody denies us a simple to-do list.
- Dunning-Kruger effect: poorer student will feel overconfident because they don't have the same self doubt as the good students

#### The benefits of writing constantly and how to do it

> Good ideas flourish in a relaxed environment.

- writing notes is the only part you need to worry about: writing that paper, essay, etc. is going to come naturally IF you have the right notes
- notes have to be concise, short, writen in your own words for better understanding and connection of thoughts, they have to be separated into lots of different topics which can be connected later!
- you can go digital or on paper, personally i write digitaly because i type faster and usually i am a very disorganised person so having the computer system helps out a lot!
- write down every new bit of information, be it big or small, a small idea, thought, etc. you never know if one day it might turn into something great!
- it is important to note that writing is not a separate task from reading, but rather an integrated part of learning. It IS studying, researching, etc.
- while writing or reading it is important to think beyond the sentences and think about the global picture, try to connect it with something else, really think about what you are reading. While it takes much longer to properly read something, it really is worth it
- rather than reading and recording everything, or writing down ideas and questions randomly in the text, its important to save them into the 4 folders: *permanent notes, fleeting notes, project notes and literature notes*. Permanent notes are where all of your solidified thoughts and ideas are, things you will never delete and use time and time again. The fleeting notes section is where you store random thoughts, bits of text, etc. and after a short amount of time you review the notes and put them accordingly to the permanent notes pile or discard them if they are irrelevant. Project notes are used for specific projects. Literature notes are used for writing permanent notes about the books you read!
- it is important to collect good ideas, but to collect them properly!

#### Motivation
- the differences between a growth and fixed mindsets are huge, and its important to have a growth mindset!
>Nothing motivates us better than the experience of becoming better at what we do.

-> let the work motivate you to read, study and learn new things
- as we improve our slip-box we improve ourselves and learn new things!
- it is also important to note that when writing, we never start with a blank page or screen. Using a slip box, we always have some research, ideas, arguments, etc. to start our writing process with. Everything is writen in our words, in a way we understand hence we can easily form written prose. We don't have to "pick a theme", it is already picked out before by ourselves
- our brain is extremely unreliable, and we usually remember false information, we cannot remember everything, so it is important to have a system like a slip box to remember all of our questions, ideas, etc. 
#### Multitasking and focus
- Multitasking is extremely bad for our mental capacity for learning and staying focused. Studies show that **there are multiple types of focus**, and each requires a different way of thinking and is used for different tasks. When we multitask, what we really do is switch between one task and the other with very high frequency, which fatigues us and tires us. This shouldn't happen!
- it is very important to limit distractions, not to multitask and *to give the right attention to every task we do.*
- it was shown that *Nobel prize winners have a daily workflow with **flexible focus, rather than sheer relentless focus.!!***
> The key to creativity is being able to switch between a wide-open, playful mind and a narrow analytical frame.

#### Planning and expertism
> The moment we stop making plans is when we start to learn.
- it is important to not plan everything and to try things even if they fail, that we need to have the freedom to make our own choices and to make mistakes! Even though we think of mistakes as a bad thing, making them helps us learn from them.
> **Experts**: have internalised the necessary knowledge so they don't have to actively remember rules or think consciously about their choices.

- we can hold a maximum of 7 things at a time in our head, +- 2 things. This is not a lot! So, we need to optimize what we are thinking about and what we want to store.
- it is much easier to remember something we understood properly and with context so our minds can place it somewhere, rather than randomly trying to remember facts which we won't remember after 2 days.
- **Zeigarnik effect:** open tasks occupy our short term memory until they are finished. As soon as they are, we forget about them. this is one of the reasons why we are distracted by unfinished tasks: they aren't finished! This might also be why to-do lists and plans bother us.
- this is why it is important to **write all the tasks down** so that they stay **out of our head!** This way we dont have to remember them, because the paper 'remembers' it.
- it is also cool to leave some questions you want to think about open and not writen down. Then the brain automatically works on the problem while you do something else!

#### Decision making and willpower
- it is important to lessen the amount of decisions we need to make so we have more room for more important thoughts.
	- this can be things like always having an outfit ready in the morning, having a routine for breakfast so you don't have to choose what to eat, etc. Simple things like these so that the actual studying and learning can take place in an open environment
	- having one system for taking in information and doing schoolwork takes a lot of pressure of our hands and enables us to be more productive for actual work
- taking breaks is **instrumental** to making studying work. It is best to study first, then **go for a walk, take a nap, exercise, ...** some task which doesn't require that much thinking and enables us to process our thoughts and enable them to go to long term memory.
- willpower is often very hard to achieve, and it depletes our ego, or ability to work on self. So, the best way to tackle this is to gaslight ourselves that the task we are about to do is super important for our work

### Reading with Understanding
- it is always important to read something with a pen or highlighter in hand (keep it super simple) so you can underline things you want to copy or think about more
- it is very important that when writing your notes for the slip/box that we don't copy the notes, rather we think about what we read and then write down in our own words what was writen and our perspective on it. This way we develop ideas more easily (the slip-box naturally enables that) 
-  a crucial tip while writing notes and reading a text is not to affirm our **confirmation bias**. This means we write and read things in a way which confirms our previous beliefs which aren't correct (maybe yes maybe no)
- it is always important to write every argument as it is and how it connects with our previous cards
- n *"Have the courage to use your own understanding"* - Immanuel Kant
-  taking smart notes and constantly thinking about what you are reading is much more valuable than knowing something, because it allows you to think critically about everything around you, and it enables you to be clear to somebody else: people who are able to get a point across in a simple way are deemed smarter and they really are! 
	- This is why your notes should always be simple and as short as possible: getting to the point. 
- it is super important to understand that just by reading something we don't really know it, and **if we can't explain it simply to ourselves or somebody else, we don't understand it.** 
- rereading is extremely bad for your studying, as you don't learn anything you don't already know about, and it doesn't make you understand anything. Writing notes while reading or shortly after you read is a much better way to do this, but not in the standard format but rather the slip-box you are hopefully writing these notes right now.
- only reading and doing nothing else (cramming) is not even considered learning by researchers. It is very bad for learning since you actually don't remember, understand and definitely don't learn anything.
- the best way to learn is called
	- eg ELABORATION: this type of learning is when reading something, you think deeply about the subject, what you are reading, what questions do you have, how does this connect to something else you read, etc.
- it was found that intelligent people while reading asked questions and thought beyond what was said, rather than followed everything what was said and didn't think about anything.
- writing about things we read about in an engaging way, maybe including a picture or two, writing our understanding of it with mindsets of other people help us understand it and learn it. Writing down *only* quotes <mark style="background: #BABD8D;">isn't gonna help</mark>
- writing with the slip-box is very productive, and it allows you to amount a massive amount of information, connections and ideas to write about. I noticed how in my writing it has made things significantly easier, and it made writing posts and video-scripts much easier. Writing a few notes every day is an extremely productive start, and it helps us develop ourselves in the long term, rather than focusing on writing a certain number of paragraphs or pages a day. 
- n *"Real thinking requires some kind of externalization."*
- writing down questions we have while reading thoughtfully and trying to find out why and write that down, in connection to other notes in the slip-box is a very learning prone process
- remembering everything is actually extremely bad for learning: when we try to remember everything word for word, or we try to remember facts, we lose meaning of the whole conversation: we don't understand it, can't connect it, so basically **it is useless.**
- scientists think that we actually remember almost everything we ever experienced, but there is a mental barrier which blocks most memories to us because they aren't useful in our daily lives! Or, maybe we just forget them because we don't strengthen the connections and bonds. 
- we should work with our memory like building a city: connecting houses and streets and avenues by winding roads and bridges, strengthening the connection of information
- n *"Every piece of information can become the trigger for another piece of information."*
- n *"The first step of elaboration us to think enough about a piece of information to write about it. The second step is  to think about what it means for other contexts as well."*
- if you try to understand everything, you will effortlessly learn things! You don't even have to try.

#### Building ideas
- the slip-box is an extension of the mind: we think **with** it, **in it**, we don't think about it.
- it is important to put correct keywords in every note so they are easily retrievable later, and so that when we look at them we really see what's going on. It will be easier to connect things which aren't so broad, but rather more specific (I'll keep this in m ind for my note-taking)
- it is important to link topics together in notes because they provide ideas and connections you might have never thought about, which can enhance your later writing. 
- the most important part of taking notes is the reviewing process after writing them! It is important to read your notes at a later date, update them, compare the previous version and what you want to change, how did your view change, etc. 
- the slip-box is kind of like a "tool for thinking", and we can make **learning fun** using it!
- instead of using flashcards to memorize and actively recall certain processes or terms in order to remember them without putting them in your laticework of notes, or your mind is useless (however flashcards can still be made with context)
- using the slip-box encourages us to make a mental model and to ingrain new knowledge and understanding in an already existing framework 
- for creativity, the slip-box is like an **experimental space**, a place where ideas form and are nurtured, sometimes without us even noticing! 
- also, the brain is created for seeing patterns and visualizing things in front of our eyes or senses, so scanning something is better for making connections and actively focusing on that one specific topic!
