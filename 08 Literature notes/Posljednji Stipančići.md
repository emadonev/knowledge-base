Even though this book was extremely hard to read due to language (it was written in the 19th century), and the style was difficult to understand sometimes, the underlying message was clear. It talked about a succesful and promising family, the Stipančići and their demise due to greed, untruthworthiness, poor childcare and false claims about the world around them. 

**Family**:
- Lucija Stipančić
- Ante Stipančić
- Valpurga Stipančić
- Juraj Stipančić

LUCIJA STIPANČIĆ
Lucija was the daughter of Valpurga and Ante, the youngest in the family and with the most spirit. Being a girl, she was oppressed in the family, not given any love or attention by her father and denied many things she wanted like an education or even going to parties and having friends. Her father was so entitled that she could not play with the "city kids" because they are not up to her level. She was always extremely isolated, and until 6 could not eat at the family table. Her father treated her as an object and did not leave her any money. Her mother, even though she loved Lucija did not step up to bring her a better life. Lucija had to fight for herself, and she did so whenever she could. She would often fight back her father, read many novels instead of intelectual books just to displease her father, and always stood up for herself because nobody else would. After her father died, her brother and friend came to beg for money, but the friend "fell in love" with Lucija. Being so lonely her whole life she took the love as if it meant something more even though he was just joking around. After they left and sold the house, she and her mother moved to a small house and Lucija contracted tuberculosis. She also realised that she was pregnant and had to abort the child because the friend did not want it and because he would never come back for her. She fell really ill, and was depressed because the friend would not write back letters. She had not realised that he never meant the love. Her mother, trying to save her from killing herself, employed a secret lover of Lucija to write letters instead of the love of her life and it worked. However, Lucija was an extremely smart girl and soon realised the letters were fake and became more ill. She finally died in the secret lovers arms. 

Lucija represented a strong woman of the 19th century who believed in herself and would not let herself be bullied. She is a role model for today where women in some countries are still oppresed. 

ANTE STIPANČIĆ
Ante was the father of Lucija and Juraj and he was "the monster" of the story. Yes, that is absolutely true, however he is not the only one to blame as seen from the way Valpurga supported her daughter. He was oppresive, always seeking a side who will give him money, trusted his son more than anything in the world and teaching him the same values about women and money and status. He despised Lucija and they often fought about various things. He would not let her get educated or court with other men. He cut off her wings and her future. He was a liar and cheat, with almost no emotions and had a tendency to monopolise and control everything in the quest for a higher status, fame and more money.

VALPURGA STIPANČIĆ
Valpurga married young, as all women. She thought her husband was amazing but only because he did not let her think otherwise. She bore 2 children and was denied any love or affection towards her son. She was not strong like Lucija. She bent over any mans will and would not like to make them unhappy, which did not help Lucija when she was denied love and care from her father. She said maybe a few things, but would never leave him or divorce him or tell him how horrible she is. In a way, Valpurga is also not a good character of the story because she denied her child many things that Juraj had. She never fought against Antes will and that made her weak. In a way she denied her daughters education just because he said she could not go. She cheated her daughters with the fake letters instead of forcing her to view the truth and make her daughter realize what was happening. As a quote from [[Six of Crows and Crooked Kingdom]] would say:

> *"Better terrible truths than kind lies"*

JURAJ STIPANČIĆ
Juraj was the son of Ante and Valpurga and we do not know much about him. He was separated from his mother and sister and he did not even know he had a sister until he was around 27. He was "smart" so his father sent him to university and flooded all of his money to Juraj. In a series of letters Juraj admitts that he hates his father and his family and never loved anyone. He changed his name so that it is of Hungarian origin, a serious betrayal at the time for Croatians. He got tangled up in a lot of problems, needed a lot of money to pay off debts and such. He went down and could never get back up. All by choice.
