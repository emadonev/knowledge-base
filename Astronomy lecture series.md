A lecture series which is potentially in MIOC!!!!!

- I want to invite students to come and listen to a long term astronomy lecture, kind of like a seminar which would start at the beginning of 2025 - kind of like a semester course.
- classes would probably be once every 2 weeks, since neither I nor the kids can handle more - unless they specifically ask me to! 
	- this gives us around 12 lectures to work with!!!

## 01 - introduction (1 hour - 1,5 hours)
---
In this lecture, I would talk about *everything wonderful*  in the universe, introducing students to everything there is in here.

- [?] Starting Q would be: **what do you think of when I say "space" or "universe"**?

Then, we would have a nice discussion, and I would proceed to show pictures and talk a bit about:
- planets (solar system)
	- exoplanets!
- comets/asteroids
- stars
	- giants, white dwarfs, red dwarfs, brown dwarfs,...
	- planetary nebulae
	- neutron stars, black holes,...
- star clusters
- galaxies
- ...

## 02 - what do we see in the sky? (2-2,5 hours)
---
After the introduction, we would start our astronomical journey by *examining the night sky - constellations, celestial sphere, **coordinate systems!!***


## 03 - what do we even see? (2 hours)
---
Once we have familiarized ourselves with what is possible and what we can see with the naked eye, the next obvious question is, well, **how** do we see all these stars? So, the topic of interest is *light, and all the information light can give us - spectroscopy, the nature of light, EM spectrum* - to be clear, we aren't tackling radiation mechanisms of stars, just light as a form of energy and information.

## 04 - beyond the eyes (2-2,5 hours)
---
Now that we know what and how we are seeing with our eyes, let's take things further with an instrument - *telescopes!* The whole lecture we'll be discussing how telescopes came to be, talk about optics, how to describe a telescope, which telescopes are good for what - and then we'll move from backyard telescopes to big chunky ones, different ones for different light, etc.

## 05 - wandering stars - part 01 (2-2,5 hours)
---
In this lecture, we'll finally begin to talk about our first astronomical object - **planets!** In this first lecture, we'll only tackle *orbital dynamics* - now this is a very wide topic, so we'll constrain ourselves with planetary orbits and elements of orbits, how we describe them, etc. 

## 06 - wandering stars - part 02 (2 hours)
---
Once we know **how** planets move, we'll discuss various planetary types, exoplanets, the mechanisms of planets (in particular Mars), and a bit of planetary science (oooo)
