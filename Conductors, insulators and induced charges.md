As discussed in [[Electric charge]], [[Electron]]s tend to transfer from one object to another. Objects which really **like to transmit electrons** are called ***conductors***, while objects which do not are ***insulators***. Most metals are really good conductors since their outermost [[Electron shell]] *has a lot of free electrons*, which can then move about freely. Most non-metals are good insulators for the same reason, except the outer layer doesn't have any or extremely few free electrons. 

We can also charge objects by method of *induction*, where we transfer electrons onto some neutral object and they stay on the object, causing it to be charged even though it was originally neutral. It is also possible for *a charged object to attract neutral objects*. This sort of reminds me of [[Van der Val forces]], where neutrals are attracted to each other. The key is that **polarization occurs**, or the atoms inside the neutral object are slightly oriented in one charged direction, which is enough for a opposites-attract situation.
