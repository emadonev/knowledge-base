As discussed in [[Derivatives]], we can describe continuous quantities by taking their **derivative** - trying to look for an instantaneous change. We achieve this by drawing a *tangent line*, however, how do we really draw a tangent? 

If we have a graph of a function, and we want to draw the tangent, we would probably take our point of interest and draw a point further away on the graph to get the **slope.** The definition of a slope is:$$a = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$$, or *rise over run.* Now, the closer we chose the second point towards the first point, ***the value of the slope is going to ==approach== the tangent.*** Hence, we have a **==limiting of the slope of secant lines==** as they approach the real tangent. We describe this as:$$\lim_{Q\ce{->}R} m_{QR} = m$$, where $Q,R$ are the 2 points. 

A **limit** is the value *a function approaches*, but can never quite reach since nothing is really *instantaneous.*
