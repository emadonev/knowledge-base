> A **function** $f$ is a rule which assigns to each element $x$, part of a set $D$ exactly *one element*, $f(x)$ in a set $E$. $D$ is called the **domain of the function** (all possible inputs), while $E$ is the **range.** (all possible outcomes)

- elements of the domain are **independent** - we chose which one we would like to *transform* into another value, $f(x)$.
- elements of the range are **dependent** on the *element chosen from the domain*!

A function is described by its **equation**, or the way we transform a certain input into an output. We can present a **graph** of a function, as the set of all values such that: ${(x, f(x)) | x \;\epsilon \;D}$

We can define a function 4 different ways:
1. verbally (description with words)
2. numerically (a table of values)
3. visually (a graph)
4. algebraically (an explicit formula, such as $f(x) = ax+b$)

- !! A super important test which determines if a graph is a function or not is the **vertical line test** - if the line passes through more than 1 point, then it can't be a function!

- eg A function with *different definitions based on a subset of the domain* is called a **piecewise defined function.**

>An **even function** is one where $$f(-x) = f(x)$$, for example a parabola! In other words, these *functions are symmetrical via the y axis.*

> An **odd function** is one where:$$f(-x) = -f(x)$$, and these functions are *symmetric around the origin*

Finally, functions aren't static and over their domains they constantly **increase or decrease**. Hence, we define a function $f$ as increasing over some interval $I$ if:$$f(x_1) < f(x_2), \;\;x_1<x_2\;\epsilon\;I$$
And the function $f$ is decreasing if:$$f(x_1) > f(x_2), \;\;x_1<x_2\;\epsilon\;I$$
