Okay, okay, for all of you that are confused. Before I begin explaining, it is important to understand that an "orbit" and an "orbital" are two completely different things. So every atom's electrons occupy energy levels, which are also called orbits, which are those circles you see around the nucleus of an atom in those diagrams you see. An energy level could be 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on, and is usually represented in chemistry by the variable "n". Note that these types of diagrams aren't showing literally how the electrons look when they travel around a nucleus; that is dictated by energy sublevels, so try to put it out of your mind that electrons always look like circles around the nucleus all the time. These energy sublevels, are the s, p, d, and f that he was talking about. These sublevels dictate the shape of the path that the electrons are most likely to travel through; so basically, that's what an orbital is: the shape of the path an electron is most likely to take when it travels around its nucleus. An orbital of the s sublevel looks like a plain circle; a p sublevel orbital looks like an infinity sign; a d sublevel orbital looks like a 4 leaf clover; an f sublevel orbital takes a shape that... really doesn't have a name. Every orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons that have opposite spins, and every sublevel has a maximum capacity for orbitals; the s sublevel holds 1 orbital, the p sublevel holds 3, the d sublevel holds 5, the f sublevel holds 7, and so on. So now you might be thinking, okay, so it'll be 1s 1p 1d 1f, then 2s 2p 2d and 2f, but in fact, that's incorrect. Through Bohr's discoveries, he found that the first energy level can only hold two electrons, the second can hold 8 electrons, the third can hold 8 electrons, the fourth can hold 18 electrons, and the fifth can also hold 18 electrons. You can actually see this in the periodic table; the first period only has 2 elements, the second period has 8, the third has 8, the fourth has 18, and the fifth also has 18. So in order from least to greatest energies, this is how energy levels and their sublevels are written; 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, and so on as shown in the small graph below
1s <--- 
2s <--- 
3s 2p <--- 
4s 3p <--- 
5s 4p 3d <--- 
6s 5p 4d <--- 
7s 6p 5d 4f <--- 
8s 7p 6d 5f <--- 

Now a way that scientists show these is by using electron orbital diagrams, which is basically using boxes and arrows to show orbitals and electrons, as well as their spins, in an orbital (since I can't form shapes I'll just use brackets, ^ for up spinning electron, and v for down). There are, however, three exceptions to how electrons are filled into energy levels of atoms, and these rules must also be followed when creating an electron orbital diagram of the configuration of electrons.  -

Electrons fill orbitals of the lowest energy first (Aufbau Principle) 
Example: 1s [^ v] 2s[   ]  and then 1s[^ v] 2s [^  ]                 

-A maximum of two electrons can fit in an orbital, but they must have opposite spins (Pauli Exclusion Principle)  

Example: 1s [^ v]             
This would be wrong --> 1s [^ ^] or this 1s [^ v] -

Electrons will fill all orbitals of a sublevel with one electron before pairing up (Hund's Rule) 

Example: First fill in each of 2p's orbitals with one electron 

1s [^ v] 2s [^ v] 2p [^  ] [^  ] [^  ] 

Then fill the rest of the missing spots with electrons with opposite spins 

1s [^ v] 2s [^ v] 2p [^ v] [^ v] [^ v] 

Note that in every element, not all of their orbitals will be filled with electrons. Elements that do not have all of their orbitals satisfied because they still have unpaired electrons are called paramagnetic. Those that do have all of their electrons paired are called diamagnetic. Electromagnetic fields have more effect on atoms that are paramagnetic. Now as Hank mentioned, noble gasses are non-reactive. This is because they are all diamagnetic, and all of their electrons are paired. Let's take the electron configuration of neon for example. 

1s [^ v] 2s [^ v] 2p [^ v] [^ v] [^ v] 

As you can see, all of neon's electrons are paired. Now sometimes, you may be asked to write down the electron configuration of an atom. This is basically the written version of an electron orbital diagram. In the case of Neon, its electron configuration would be-    
2      2     6 
1s    2s    2p 
The superscript number is showing how many electrons are in that entire sublevel. By dividing that number by two, that will tell you how many orbitals are in that sublevel, because each orbital can hold a pair of electrons. Now say you had an element like Magnesium (Mg). The electron configuration of that would be- 
2      2     6     
2 1s    2s    2p   3s 
Electron configurations can be abbreviated using noble gasses like this- 
2 
(Ne) 3s 
Another important matter to note are valence electrons. Valence electrons are electrons in the outermost energy level or an atom and are usually the only electrons involved in chemical processes. Valence electrons will always be electrons in the s and p sublevels of an energy level.  Hope this helps!
