We know that we do not know exactly how NN's work, they are a black box. We also know that without Activation functions, NN's cannot work. If the [[Non-linearity]] systems are extremely tied to chaos, and they give variance to later performance by altering the parameters (weights) of the system, does that mean **that NN's work because of chaos theory?**
