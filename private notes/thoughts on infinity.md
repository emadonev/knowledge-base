Our universe, filled with stars, galaxies and planets. Our universe, filled with amazing spectacles and wonders far beyond what we imagined. It is so beautiful, and we wish for beautiful things to be infinite. But, is the universe really infinite? Would the beauty of the universe lose its lits glamor because there is always more to see? We love powerful things. Beautiful things. We love mystery and the thrill of the unknown. But do mysteries become less mysterious if there is always another one? If the universe were infinite, there would be infinite possibilities. If the universe were infinite, something unexpected could always happen. Can our world stretch out into infinity? Can all of our knowledge, laws and ideals be stretched out to cover the infinite plane of the universe?
